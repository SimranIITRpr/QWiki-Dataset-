In programming assignment 2 you asked that take Indian rupees as input and output will be the currency in Euros.But in test cases your inputs(Ex.20) are in euros, the outputs are in rupees(Ex.1600). My kind request is please change it, as soon as possible. Thank you :-)

Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)
I faced the exact same problem, until I realised they wanted output in rupees and input in euros, opposite to what was asked in the question.

Thanks for brining it up. I hope the mentors or course in charge correct it.

Assignment 1 solution doubt
9 comments â€¢ 2 months ago
Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)
Assigment 1 Question 9, says

Which of the following constructs carries out a set of instructions as long as any key in the keyboard is pressed?

Apparently answer is given as repeat until key any pressed?

However, this would make the loop run until any key is pressed. As soon as we press any key it stops running the loop.

In the question it was asked to select the option which would make the code run as long as the key is pressed. So I don't know how the solution is correct and how I was wrong in selecting none of the above.

Can anyone explain ?

Reply 2 months ago
Vvkcdm (talkcontribs)
As you said repeat until construct will make the loop run until any key is pressed. So execute a set of instructions repeatedly until a key in the keyboard is pressed we will make use of repeat until construct. Hence the answer.

Reply 2 months ago
Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)
But the question specifically states 'as long as any key is pressed' which means, we need a loop construct that would activate when a key is pressed and continue till it is pressed, not repeat when the key is not pressed and stop when the key is pressed.

Hot9cups (talkcontribs)
I second Pythoncourse123

I had asked the exact doubt and am waiting for the answer as well.

'As long as' indeed means that the loop should be repeated even if I press the key for, say 10 seconds.. But repeat until will end the loop within a second of pressing the key.. It's gonna end the loop as long as the key is pressed..

So I really think the correct answer should be 'None of the above'.

Reply 2 months ago
Pranav24b (talkcontribs)
Here 'as long as' applies to the 'set of instructions' and not the key.

Refer This


What you are thinking would be phrased as 'Which of the following constructs carries out a set of instructions as long as any key in the keyboard is kept pressed?'

Reply Edited 2 months ago
Hot9cups (talkcontribs)
If it did refer to the set of instructions, the question should have been 'as long as any key is not pressed'. The question meant to say 'until a key is pressed' but was ambiguously worded.

There is a big difference between until and as long as.

So I really don't think it's right to penalise 'None of the above' option.

Reply 2 months ago
Hot9cups (talkcontribs)
Even in the link you sent me, the 'as long as' section, the example is: You can play in the living room as long as you donâ€™t make a mess.

And not 'as long as you make a mess'...

Does that make it clear?

Reply 2 months ago
Pranav24b (talkcontribs)
As long as and so long as

 As long as or so long as also means â€˜provided thatâ€™, â€˜providing thatâ€™ or â€˜on condition thatâ€™:

You are allowed to go as long as you let us know when you arrive.

So long as is a little more informal:

You can borrow the car so long as you donâ€™t drive too fast.

Hot9cups (talkcontribs)
Did you even read my last post? No. You just decided to post whatever you felt like, ignoring to see if it added anything of value to the topic, or the question asked.

It is not a herculean task, to prove that 'repeat until' is the right answer to the question if seen from a point of view.

The thing asked, was that the wording is ambiguous and hence can be looked at from more than one point of view, neither of which is grammatically wrong.

This isn't an argument where you just post whatever you feel like just to prove your point. Please read what you write before posting such things.

Question by goluharsha@gmail.com Why does c have so much of coding than Python?
Edited 3 months ago
Vvkcdm (talkcontribs)
With time programming is getting easier. You feel C is complicated because you actually give almost every atomic instructions. In Python code appears shorter because of abstractions. By this I mean a lot of frequently required features are grouped into what is called libraries. Using that libraries you can make your code appear shorter.

Any reason for not listing the Lecture Notes pages in the Main Page?
7 comments â€¢ 3 months ago
Jkmadathil (talkcontribs)
Hi, <br> The idea of using a wiki for collating the notes and the discussions is a really great one. I prefer this learning rather than "from the video" or "assignment" model used in NOC. Any specific reason why the "Lecture Notes" pages are not linked from the main page? -- Since this may be the first time that many users will see discussion routed through Wiki in an NPTEL course, some explanation of the concept of this Wiki and philosophy behind this initiative will be really helpful. -- For a first time wiki user like me, the interface is slightly daunting. Even familiarity with Wikipedia doesn't teach an average person to look into "Discussion" or explore the wiki pages. -- It may be a good idea to add the videos used in this FAQ page in the course itself. Maybe create a section like JOCWiki (like Week 1,2 etc) Also a suggestion on FAQ: Pretty sure that FAQs are going to increase as the course move along. Would be nice to categorize FAQs using sections and subsections in the Wiki. For instance - General, JOCWiki, Week 1-concepts, Week1-Scratch, Week2, so on and so forth. Minor Technical Question on Wiki: The MarkUp page is throwing an error. I had selected the preview mode in my preferences. Will it not work in Discussion page?

Thank You Simran and Sudarshan!! <br> All of you at JOC are doing fantastic work. Was really thrilled to see course team taking extra efforts to make the course more engaging for the learner. "Joy of Learning with Joy of Computation" is what came to my mind as soon as I saw this wiki. <br/> @Simran: The main page looks compact and good. One possible recommendation: Since SuperNotes is the primary activity you want to encourage participants to be engaged in, give it a more prominent position by either putting it up or giving a TOC.<br/> To check if this has made an effect, see the change in the rate of learners who are accessing the supernotes after you make this change. I saw close to 30 new user registrations yesterday. @Sudarshan: Some additional thoughts, see if it is making sense. <br/> - For popularizing the JOCwiki and actually see learner contributions, it will be worthwhile to put a dedicated activity in Week 2/3 where learners are encouraged to come and see the wiki, post a note, engage in discussion etc. You can incentivize this by putting 1-2 assignment questions on the JOCwiki. From my experience with Indian online learners, directives with incentives work better than recommendations. <br/> - If you can put one takeaway image/slide in the Weekly note, i.e. something that the learner should always keep in mind even if they forget/don't access the videos & assignments, it will become a tangible artifact for the learner.<br/>

Hi Priya, It is very easy to learn any language. The gold mine here is to understand the logic behind every problem. Once you understand the logic, writing the program in a particular language is very easy.

I am trying to make a sprite do two actions simultaneously. I want to do the exercise plus I want it to recite a 15's table. I can do it one after the other. How to do it simultaneously? Question asked by herahassan2007@gmail.com

It can be done easily. Add one more instruction in the program along with 15 table recitation in the loop without any delay. In this way, cat will recite the table and then move without any delay. This will go in a loop till the number of times you have specified.

Question by Rohith why do we are supposed to learn about scratch and how is that related to python learning?.
Edited 3 months ago
Vvkcdm (talkcontribs)
As we had said in our videos, we don't assume any prerequisites. Scratch is a simple programming language that a 8 year old can learn. What is important is learning programming logic. With this simpler one if you understand what we call as programming logic and can think on what logic to apply to solve a problem, you can easily learn any programming language not just Python.

R is mostly used for statistical analysis. As far as it is concerned to AI, both languages are used for AI in the current scenario.

Which language is best..

Simmi (talkcontribs)
It's application specific. Based on the application, you can compare them. AI is a broader term. We need to narrow down to a specific application.

So are we going to use just scratch or will you be doing programming in python?

Since this is a 0th level course, we started off with programming language like Scratch. Eventually we will be shifting to Python in the forthcoming weeks.

what about fact that the value of a variable may be a garbage value, if it is not initialized to zero or any number. i have learned some languages like c and c++ and i experienced that the value of an uninitialised variable being zero.Do this concept change in python, could you pls clarify me.

Yes Surendhar, you are right. This does happen in C,C++. Well this is too early to ask. We will be explaining all these things in the forthcoming sessions. But even in Python, you must initialise a variable.
