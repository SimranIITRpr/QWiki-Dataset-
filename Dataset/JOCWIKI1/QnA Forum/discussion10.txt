Assignment 10 : Questions 6 & 7
16 comments • ‪3 months ago‬



‪Indrag79 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Dear All,‬
‪This is regarding the purpose as mentioned in the header line of the topic.‬
‪Firstly, the answer to Question 6 of Assignment 10 should be the 4th option, i.e., None of the above, as the other closest 2nd option, i.e., x is 3*3 matrix comprising of zeros is incorrect.‬
‪Reason - 1: Actually instead of import numpy as np x=np.zeros(3,3) [i.e, one more parenthesis () is missing the absence of which would lead to the generation of an error message "TypeError: data type not understood"] it should have been import numpy as np x=np.zeros((3,3)) [i.e, presence of one more parenthesis () would not generate any error message thereby leading to a 3*3 matrix comprising of zeros]‬
‪Secondly, the answer to Question 7 of Assignment 10 should also be the 4th option, i.e., None of the above, as the other closest 3rd option, i.e., (2,3) is incorrect.‬
‪Reason - 2: Now here the given function, i.e., a.shape() has got parenthesis which would produce an error message "TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable". Instead of the parenthesis (), i.e., a.shape, the correct answer would have been (2,3).‬
‪Hence, my understanding along with the above explanations says that the answers to these two specific questions need to be re-evaluated.‬
‪So kindly share your opinion in this regard.‬
‪Thank you!‬

‪Hi Sir/Leads,‬
‪I have the same opinion. The answers have to be "None of the above" for questions 6 and 7 for Week 10 assignment.‬
‪Can you please look into this and if possible re-evaluate the quiz for week 10.‬
‪Thanks, Balakrishna‬

‪Hi All,‬
‪Just to update you all that one of our TA's Amit Kumar Verma has confirmed me by mail that these two specific questions 6 & 7 of Assignment 10 would be re-evaluated.‬
‪In case, any one of you have any further updates in this regard then request you to let us know accordingly.‬
‪Thank you.‬

‪Hello Mates,‬
‪This is to further update you that the "Questions 6 & 7 of Assignment 10" have already been re-evaluated and the latest marks have now been properly reflected under the 'Progress' section of the course site.‬
‪So all of you could now check whether the same has been done at your end or not.‬
‪Thank you!‬

‪Rakesh (talkcontribs)‬
‪As my understanding and the practicals shown in the videos there is some mistake in the evaluation.‬
‪Question # 6:-import numpy as np x=np.zeros(3,3) What is x in the above code snippet?‬
‪This one is not correct syntax so output will be an error. The correct answer should be 'None of the above'. Because either it should be x=np.zeros((3,3)) or x=np.zeros[(3,3]).‬

‪Question #7:- If a is 2*3 numpy array, what would the function a.shape() return?‬
‪Again answer should be 'None of the above'. Because as shown in tutorials videos shape is a property not a function and correct syntax should be 'a.shape' but in the question it is a trick (a.shape()).‬
‪Based upon the practical demos these are correct outputs and can be cross checked. Please re-evaluate the assignment 10.‬

‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪Suppose the values are 1,3,5 in sequence of 5. As you can see 2 and 4 is missing in this sequence. Instead 2 and 4 they inserted -1 in place of missing number and scramble it. So we get input as -1,5,-1,3,1 we have write to sort this sequence into(increasing order) like this: 1, -1, 3, -1, 5‬

‪I couldn't get you. The question is‬
‪"You are provided with a number D containing only digits 0's and 1's. Your aim is to convert this number to have all the digits same. For that, you will change exactly one digit i.e. from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. If it is possible to make all digits equal (either all 0's or all 1's) by flipping exactly 1 digit then output "YES", else print "NO" (quotes for clarity).‬
‪Input Format: The first line of the input contains the number D made of only digits 1's and 0's.‬
‪Output: Print 'YES' or 'NO' depending on whether its possible to make it all 0s or 1s or not. "‬

‪Aditianmol (talkcontribs)‬
‪It's quite simple, just count the occurrences of 0's and 1's in the given number by either converting the given number to a list or treating it as a string. If any of the 2 digits have a single occurrence, then you can change it and hence answer is "yes" else the number can not be converted and therefore answer is "NO"‬

   print("NO")



Above code have no mistake. But if you think above is designed for Assignment1 week 10. Then you didnt understand the question.
You code is counting how many zero's and one's
are in input. If number of one and zero are equal. You are printing yes otherwise no.
This is not assignment requirement.


Question is :
You are provided with a number D containing only digits 0's and 1's. Your aim is to convert this number to have all the digits same.
For that, you will change exactly one digit i.e. from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0. If it is possible to make all digits equal
(either all 0's or all 1's) by flipping exactly 1 digit then output "YES", else print "NO"

Question Explanation: Is possible to to make all zero's or all one's just by changing one(only one) digit from either (0 to 1) or (1 to 0)

SPYDER SHOWING RIGHT OUTPUT BUT NOT THE ONLINE COMPILER OF NPTEL

‪Anu (talkcontribs)‬
‪Hello friends, I was wrote a code for changing a digit of to 0 to 1 and vice versa (programming assignment 1) Though I'm getting the satisfactory output as per given example test cases in spyder ide but while executing the code online on nptel platform it's showing wrong output for the same two test cases I got right in spyder. If you allow I would like to share my code too for reference.‬

‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪Publicly sharing code is not recommendable. You share one to one or part of code which is creating problem.‬

Or probably didn't understand the question properly.
I cleared all 3 programs with 100/100. And didnt find any difficulty.  

Even i find this week Programming assignment the Easiest if compared with last few weeks.

‪Do all matching charcters need to strike out or only 1 par? like from "aba" and "ade" do both a from "aba" will be crossed out or only one 'a' ?‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Indrag79 (talkcontribs)‬
‪The common letters between two words should be stricken out on a one-to-one basis. For e.g., between "aba" and "ade" only single 'a' should be stricken out and the remaining letters from those two words would be "ba" (i.e., from the 1st word) + "de" (i.e., from the 2nd word) => "bade" with a total remaining letters of 4. Hope this answers your query. Thanks!‬

Assignment 10 : Question 7
3 comments • ‪3 months ago‬



‪Indrag79 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Hello All, I have observed that the function a.shape(), i.e., with the parenthesis (), would generate an error message "TypeError: 'tuple' object is not callable". Whereas without the parenthesis () it would have generated the 3rd option, i.e., (2,3). So as per the given function in the question, i.e., a.shape(), the answer should be the 4th option, i.e., None of the above. Do you all agree here?‬

‪Hi, I have a query on the below question from the quiz of Assignment 10: 5) What is the output of the statement print(numpy.array([1,2,3])) in Python? - My question is - should we consider the numpy module already loaded? because the answer would be - [1 2 3] - if we consider that numpy library was already loaded. - None of the above - if we consider that numpy library was not loaded. In this case we would get compilation error. Please advise. Thanks, Balakrishna‬

‪I wrote the code using 'numpy' library and it worked well on Spyder. It worked for all the test cases. However, when I run the code in online programming assignment, it shows message " ImportError: No module named 'numpy'". Can anyone suggest a hint, where is the problem?‬
