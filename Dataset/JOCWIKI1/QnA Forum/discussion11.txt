Doubts Regarding assignment 11 solution
6 comments • ‪3 months ago‬



‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪So Basically I have doubts regarding the answers of question 4 & 6 of assignment 11.‬
‪First Q6, according to me answer should be the now() method which is used to return the current date and time and hence should be the answer instead of current() (Current also doesn't seem to be a functionality in the python library.. )‬
‪For Q4, the question is a bit ambiguous to me. The questions says...‬
‪  "WebDriver is a web automation framework that allows you to execute your‬
   programs on different browsers."
  "Different Browsers" - while 1 specific WebDriver can work only for 1 specific browser. The question can be interpreted in another way, of talking about all the WebDrivers as whole, unlike the first interpretation talking about a single WebDriver in general.
Both yield different answers, and the latter has been chosen as the correct. Please clarify !

‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Score of Question 6 has been updated to 0. So it isn't being counted.‬
‪However, no one has yet clarified about the question 4..‬
‪Please help !‬

‪Amichoksi (talkcontribs)‬
‪in progress it shows ........not in quiz. please check. what about question 4.‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Yes in quiz, the answer has not been corrected, but check the points allocated to that question. Instead of 1, it is allocated as 0 points.‬
‪For question 4, I am confused -‬
‪"WebDriver is a web automation framework that allows you to execute your programs on different browsers."‬
‪"Different Browsers" - while 1 specific WebDriver can work only for 1 specific browser. The question can be interpreted in another way, of talking about all the WebDrivers as whole, unlike the first interpretation talking about a single WebDriver in general.‬

Assignment 11 : Question 6
6 comments • ‪3 months ago‬



‪Indrag79 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Hi All,‬
‪This is regarding the purpose as mentioned in the Topic line.‬
‪Here, the answer to Question 6 of Assignment 11 should be the 2nd option, i.e., now(), as the provided answer is the 1st option, i.e., current(), which is an incorrect one due to the following reason as cited out.‬
‪Reason: On executing the following code snippet produces the desired output, i.e., the present date and time using datetime library.‬
‪Correct Code: from datetime import datetime as dt print(dt.now())‬
‪Whereas, on executing the below piece of code produces the error message "AttributeError: type object 'datetime.datetime' has no attribute 'current'"‬
‪Incorrect Code: from datetime import datetime as dt print(dt.current())‬
‪Hence, my understanding along with the above explanation says that the answer to this specific question needs to be re-evaluated.‬
‪So please share your thoughts in case if any.‬
‪Thank you.‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Sanchit3008 (talkcontribs)‬
‪When you say that m,n = input().split() , it is not creating two values - but making returning a list. For example, if input is "2000 2002", then input().split() will return ["2000", "2002"]. You can confirm this by printing values of m and n on spyder - n should be None or some garbage value. ‬
‪You can read the input like this - ‬
‪input_list = input().split()‬
‪m = input_list[0]‬
‪n = input_list[1]‬

‪It is required to take two inputs with comma separated. Use a,b=list(map(int,input().split(','))) if you want to take integer as input. By the way there is nothing wrong in x=int(input()) but this do not fill the question requirement.‬
