‪In this question its written 3m+1 so practically its false. but Q9. "is What is the sequence obtained according 3m+1 algorithm for n=12? " in this also they have used 3m+1 what should we do?‬

‪3m+1 is not collatz conjecture, it is an algebraic equation 3n+1 is collatz conjecture. Even I thought may be, question missprint(m or n) or variable(m or n) somthing like that. Plese clarify it.‬

‪Assuming you have multiple sentences which are ending with "\n", for that you are write a loop which takes each output of your method and extract only [0:-1] of it and then use join. This should solve your issue.‬
