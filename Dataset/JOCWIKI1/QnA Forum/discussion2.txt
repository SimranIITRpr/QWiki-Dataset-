Hi friends. I saw that lot of you are also struggling to understand the assignments. Especially this was difficult for me too. After going through few of the questions and googling. I understood and trying to explain through this post. I hope this will help others, like me, to understand.

NOTE: Copying and pasting this program for assignment will not work. because there are few changes and errors in the program. (unless you correct them)
I always try using trial and error method to solve programming, and i am explaining the same here. if anybody like this way of explanation. please let me know in the reply. I will try to post for the future assignments too on the last day or earlier if posting is allowed.

This is how i will approach this Question.

Read the values into the variables (l,list_a).
Reverse and save the list into another variable.
Convert the numbers in list_a, list_b to integers.
Add both (list_a, list_b) lists/arrays and save them into another variable (list_sum) OR is it really necessary?
print the list_sum as per the conditions.
Trail 1: reading the values and copying

l = 4
list_a = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]

print(list_a)   #Just for testing.
list_b = list_a
print(l)   #Just for testing.

list_b.reverse() #To reverse the list items
print(list_b)   #Just for testing.
print(list_a)   #Just for testing.
Actual Output:
 ['1', '2', '3', '4']
 4
 ['4', '3', '2', '1']
 ['4', '3', '2', '1']
Error explanation:

As you can see reverse() didn't work as expected, it effected both list_a and list_b. But the error is not because of reverse(). It is because I used usual "assign" method, list_b=list_a. This way of assigning will only create a reference, instead of copying list_a into list_b. As a result reverse will effect both list_a and list_b, as both share the same data.

Instead we should use list.copy() function as below

list_b = list_a.copy()
Trail 2: solve reverse problem

l = 4
list_a = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
list_b = list_a.copy()  #Now it will work.
print(list_a)   #Just for testing.
print(l)   #Just for testing.
list_b.reverse()
print(list_b)   #Just for testing.
print(list_a)   #Just for testing.
Actual Output:
 ['1', '2', '3', '4']
 4
 ['4', '3', '2', '1']
 ['1', '2', '3', '4']
SUCCESS! list_a is not reversed.
Trail 3: Convert lists to integers

l = int(input())
list_a = input().split()

list_b = list_a.copy()
list_b.reverse()

for i in range(l):
    list_a[i] = int(list_a[i])
    list_b[i] = int(list_b[i])

 #Below print is to see if conversion is successful or not
 print(list_a[0]+3,"-",list_b[0]+3)
Actual Output:
 4 - 7

SUCCESS! Conversion went fine and addition is accepted.
list_a[0]+3, "-", list_b[0]+3
1+3 - 4+3
4 - 7
Trail 4: add and output the list

l = 4
list_a = ["1", "2", "3", "4"]
list_sum=[] # Predefining for later use.

list_b = list_a.copy()
list_b.reverse()

for i in range(l):
    list_a[i] = int(list_a[i])
    list_b[i] = int(list_b[i])
    
    x = list_a[i] + list_b[i]
    list_sum.append(x)
    
    print(list_sum[i], end="")
    if(i<l-1):
        print(" ", end="") 
Actual Output:
 11 12 10 10 12 11
SUCCESS! output is space separated, without brackets and there is no space at the end too.
We can use below print statement at the end of the program, and exclude last 3 lines in the above "for loop".

print(*list_sum, end="")
If anyone is still unable to understand, please feel free to ask me questions. I will try my best to answer.

We can simplify this code even further. Using extra features of python. Google helped me with the below code.

But! what is the catch?
There are so many ways to solve a problem. More than one, at least. So, as a new learner, we no need to think too deep and confuse ourselves. Slowly we can pickup such techniques in future. For now, lets choose the simple ways. Try to check others answers. We are getting exposed to more possibilities. Choose the answer which is simple and good for you.

Below code is only for those, who want to know other ways too. For now lets have a little fun. Try to understand why below code is also correct. You can ask me questions, because, I understood it enough, I spent a lot of time understanding(googling).

list_sum=[]
l = int(input())
list_a = list(map(int,input().split()))

list_b = list_a.copy()
list_b.reverse()

list_sum = map(lambda x, y: x + y, list_a, list_b)

print(*list_sum, end="")

What is the function of 'map'?

And what is the use of '*' in the 'print' statement?

Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
Lets dissect list_a = list(map(int,input().split()))
This part input().split() takes the string 1 2 3 4 and splits it at space. As a result we get individual strings 1 2 3 4.
split() was able to break 1 2 3 4 into 1 2 3 4. But still all these numbers are not integers. So, we are using map(int,input().split()) to convert all these into integers.
Syntax of map is : map(function, iterable, ...)
Now we are calling int() function, through map(), and asking int to work on iterables generated by input().split().
As a result, all the numbers are converted to integers and, then gets assigned to the list list_a.
NOTE: But from Python 3, we need to convert output of map() to list, using list().
That is why, we enclosed this entire map(int,input().split()) 
in a list(map(int,input().split())).


Lets talk about print(*list_sum, end="")
That asterisk in front of list_sum will unpack the contents of list_sum and print in a single line using a " " as separator.
I didn't use the sep=" " in the print(), as it was adding spaces by default. Still it is a good idea to add this as a fail safe.
Usage will be like this print(*list_sum, sep=" ", end="")
NOTE: Check python 3 documentation, to understand print() function a little better.

Syntax:

  print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. 
sep, end, file and flush, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.

All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end. Both sep and end must be strings; they can also be None, which means to use the default values. If no objects are given, print() will just write end.

what is the end="" here? is it a predefinde fuction or what ?

Reply 7 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
sorry for the late reply.

end="" is part of print() function. By default, output of print is ended with a newline "\n". Which in our case is causing us presentation error. That is why we are asking print() function to not end with a newline "\n".
NOTE: Check python 3 documentation, to understand print() function a little better.

Syntax:

  print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False)

Print objects to the text stream file, separated by sep and followed by end. 
sep, end, file and flush, if present, must be given as keyword arguments.

All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like str() does and written to the stream, separated by sep and followed by end. Both sep and end must be strings; they can also be None, which means to use the default values. If no objects are given, print() will just write end.

The end=' ' is just to say that you want a space after the end of the statement instead of a new line character.

Refer to this code as it is easy to understand.

n=int(input()) # Taking Input and simultaneously converting it to integer.

list1=input().split() # split() function is used to take multiple inputs in a single line

list2=list1.copy() # Copying list1 in list2 using copy() function

list1.reverse() # Then reversing the first list


for i in range(n): # Converting both the strings into integer datatype

list1[i]=int(list1[i])
list2[i]=int(list2[i])

for i in range (n): # Adding the respective elements of two lists

list3=list1[i]+list2[i]
print(list3,end=" ")       # The end=' ' is just to say that you want a space after the end of the 
                                       statement instead of a new line character.

First we need to understand this. Who is passing inputs to our assignment programs?

Answer is, it is a automated process, simulating exact same way of a human passing numbers.

Secondly, remember \n means newline, or as if we are pressing "enter" key on the keyboard.

For this assignment, inputs are as below...
 4
 1 2 3 4
But for the program, it is passed as below...
  4\n1 2 3 4\n
In our program we have written code, as below, to save this information into two variables. First one is integer l and second one is list list_a.
  l = int(input())
  list_a = input().split()
As you might already know, in the above, list_a is a list.
Here input().split() are used together. Because of which, input is asked from the user, and then split() function will split the input 1 2 3 4 into individual string items, before assigning to the list_a. Below i have given the process. please continue reading to understand.
When the compiler reads l = int(input()), It will start reading "user given numbers" till the first \n. As a result "4" is assigned to "l", and compilers goes to the next line.
when the compiler reads the next line of the program, which is list_a = input().split(). It will go back, to read the rest of "user given numbers" till the next \n.
But for the second line we also used split() function. As a result 1<SPACE>2<SPACE>3<SPACE>4 is split at "<SPACE>", and assigned to the list "list_a" as individual strings, as below...
   list_a = ['1', '2', '3', '4']

Just looking at those 3 lines, you may not understand the logic. I think I have confused few of you, with the formatting of program. Sorry for that. There is a simple one line solution for this. but still as you asked, i am explaining the lengthy process.

for i in range(l):
    list_a[i]=int(list_a[i])
    list_b[i]=int(list_b[i])
    x=list_a[i]+list_b[i]
    list_sum.append(x)
    print(list_sum[i],end="")
    if(i<l-1):
        print(" ",end="") 

Those 3 lines are part of for loop. In my program

conversion to integer,
array addition,
appending addition result to a new list
final output and spaces
all these are done with in the for loop.

Those three lines are just printing the final output 6 6 6 6 6 in one line.

Using print(list_sum[i], end="") i am printing contents of list_sum one at a time. As I am using end="", print function will not append \n to the output. At this stage output will be as below
6
Then control goes to if(i<l-1):. Here "if condition" will make sure, that a space is added after every number. But space should not be added after the last number, in the final output. Lets understand how this is done.
As per our assignment test conditions, l will have the length of the list, and this length is different in every test.
So, for example, lets say l = 4. which means list_a will have 4 numbers in it, like this
[1, 2, 3, 4].
Which means at the end of list addition list_sum will have the length of 4, and will look like this
[6, 6, 6, 6]
But if we use print(list_sum), the out put will have brackets and commas too.
[6, 6, 6, 6]
To solve this, we can write a for loop, through which we will call only one number of the list and print without trailing new line \n at the end as below.
     for i in range(l):
        print(list_sum[i], end="")

This loop works fine but output of the loop will be 6666
To add spaces we will use if condition, and the condition will be if(i<l):, it will print a space using another print statement 
print(" ",end="")
Now output looks like correct, but there is a rule in the question, that the output should not have space at the end. If we see the out put of our program, it will be 
6 6 6 6 .
It is having a space at the end, because the loop will run 4 times to print 4 numbers. in the same way if condition will be checked and printed 4 times.
To correct this we reduce the loop range by one if(i<l-1):. Now everything works fine and output will be 
6 6 6 6.
I Hope this helped you understand my trick in the program.

Doubt in Assignment 3 of Week 2
14 comments • 7 months ago
Pritish shubham (talkcontribs)
Dear sir

 I am having some difficulty in understanding the solution of the assignment problem 3 of week 2. There is a line which says "for i in range(len(A)-1, -1,-1): ".Here, what does "-1,-1" represents? 
Also sir, the problem says that 1st the total numbers of input need to be specified and then the input. The output will be addition of original and its reverse of numbers.

 However, When I run the solution you have provided, if i give input as 5, but if I feed 6 numbers inputs, it shows sum of all the 6 inputs. Can you please tell me that what is the need of giving initial inputs?

   B.append(A[i])
C = [] for i in range(len(B)):

   C.append(A[i]+B[i])
for i in range(len(C)):

   if(i==len(C)-1):
       print(C[i])
   else:
       print(C[i],end=" ")

Okay. Now I understood what you mean. You are not changing anything in the above code. But you are passing...
1 2 3 4 5 6 instead of 1 2 3 4 5
and expecting it to work only for 5 digits?

Here you need to understand that, code is no-where strict or specfic about that. It will add the entire list, no matter how lengthy your input is.

If you really want to see 6 6 6 6 6. you can do that by editing the code to skip the last number. By limiting through loop.

Did you notice... In the above code N variable is nowhere used.

Possibly, instead of using len() function in the loop. we can use N and limit it to N length.

N = int(input())
A = [int(i) for i in input().split(" ")]
B = []

for i in range(N-1, -1, -1):
    B.append(A[i])
C = []
for i in range(N):
    C.append(A[i]+B[i])
for i in range(N):
    if(i==N-1):
        print(C[i])
    else:
        print(C[i],end=" ")
I didn't check the output of above code. Please let me know of the errors, if any.

Answer for your 1st question is as follows

range() Syntax:
range(start, stop, step)
start Optional. An integer number specifying at which position to start. Default is 0.
stop Generate numbers up to, but not including this number.
step Difference between each number in the sequence.
Example 1:
a = 6
for i in range(a-1, -1, -1):
    print(a,",",i)

 Example 2:
a = 6
for i in range(a-1, -1, -2):
    print(a,",",i)

 Example 3:
a = 6
for i in range(a-1, -5, -2):
    print(a,",",i)

 Example 4:
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
Check these examples. You might understand based on outputs.

I have 2 queries

1. what does "-1,-1" represents in the line - "for i in range(len(A)-1, -1,-1):"?

   This line is taken from solution of Programming Assignment 3 of week 2.
2. What will be the outcome of code if I give:

   Input = 5  (This specifies that 5 numbers need to be fed.)
   Number = 1 2 3 4 5 6 ( I had deliberately given 6th number)
  
With these input,I expected that only "1st 5 numbers" should be considered for adding the original and its reverse, despite feeding 6th number and my outcome should be - (6 6 6 6 6).
But why I am getting outcome as (7 7 7 7 7)?

6)a=5 for i in range(10) a=a+1 The correct output of this code snippet will be - error as there is no ":" present in the for loop syntax.

Even if one writes without a : in the for loop, Spyder automatically includes : in the syntax. The answer is 15! Please verify this using the IDE. Best,

The code you write is tested. Its given a set of inputs and matches the expected output to the output printed by your code. You are not passing any values because the values are being passed by the computer itself. Its like a machine is testing if the machine working is perfect or not.

:: By default, output of print is ended with a ''newline'' "'''\n'''". Which in our case is causing us presentation error. That is why we are asking ''print()'' function to not end with a ''newline'' "'''\n'''". :: So to solve this we should add '''end=""''' in ''print()'' function. <br /><code>print(*list_sum, end="")</code> '''NOTE:''' Check python 3 documentation, to understand print() function a little better. ---- '''Syntax:''' print(*objects, sep=' ', end='\n', file=sys.stdout, flush=False) Print '''objects''' to the text stream '''file''', separated by '''sep''' and followed by '''end'''. <br /> '''sep''', '''end''', '''file''' and '''flush''', if present, must be given as keyword arguments. All non-keyword arguments are converted to strings like <code>str()</code> does and written to the stream, separated by '''sep''' and followed by '''end'''. Both '''sep''' and '''end''' must be strings; they can also be <code>None</code>, which means to use the default values. If no objects are given, <code>print()</code> will just write '''end'''.<br />

Hi there, unlike any other programming language, python has no curly braces to define "scope" hence indentation is used, and because the print("hello") statement is not properly indented, hence the code will throw a syntax error.

See I am going to give you the steps. You have to implement it... 1. Initialize two arrays. One for original numbers and one for reversed form. 2. Take input the size. 3. Take input the 2nd line and store it in a variable. 4.Split the 2nd input. It will convert it into a list. 5.Convert each of the element of list into integer one by one. 6.Reverse the list and store it in another list. 7.Sum the elements of both list one by one and store it in a third list using append function. 8.Print the elements of third list one by one separated by space.

Maybe some problem occurred during installation. I think you may try to reinstall it or just see whether you can use spyder directly without anaconda navigator. If you can run spyder and import libraries, there is not much need of anaconda navigator.

You can't take input inside for statement. All the inputs in second line are given at once separated by space, so you must split them. Take input as normal....... a=input()..... Then split them... a=a.split()...... This will convert a into a list.... After that.. Make all elements of list a into integer using for loop.

Difference between pass and continue statement?
5 comments • 7 months ago

Question asked by pooja.e7943@cumail.in
Reply Edited 7 months ago
Simran (talkcontribs)
Yes, there is a difference. continue forces the loop to start at the next iteration while pass means "there is no code to execute here" and will continue through the remainder or the loop body. There is a difference between them, continue skips the loop's current iteration and executes the next iteration.

Is pass statement used practically??? Or just a theoretical concept
Reply 7 months ago
Rajiv sarkar (talkcontribs)
Pass is used extensively in professional programming. Suppose you are doing a program and writing if else statement. Now, you may want to write the else block first and test it. So you can write pass inside if and then write the else block. Then you can run and check if everything is working fine in else block. Then you can proceed with writing statements in if block and then can test them.

Problem is in line 8, try writing s.append(b[i] + rev[i]). The issue is we can't assign value to a list position if it does not exists. The append will make sure the position in list is there.
Reply 7 months ago
Rajiv sarkar (talkcontribs)
There are a few errors in your code. 1. Don't take input inside for loop. Since you are using split function, just write a=input().split(), this will be all. After that you can convert them to integer inside for loop, that you have done right. 2.Dont write rev=b.reverse()....... It will make b reverse itself and original b will be lost. Write rev=list(reversed(b)) 3.you can't write s[i] =b[i] + rev[i], instead write s.append(b[i]+rev[i]).......this is because when it executes, in the first step it becomes s[0]=b[0]+rev[0] but there is no s[0], still now it was a list with no items so s[0] simply don't exist and it can't be assigned anything. 4.make the required changes and your code will run fine. You will understand this answer more clearly when you do more and more programming :)

You can't change object type of a List to Integer directly like this, There are ways to do that, you can Google it.

Let me explain you the example: Input: 4 2 5 3 1 Output: 3 8 8 3 First you have to take an input from the user. Suppose you have taken 4 as input. Then, after taking the input you have to initialize a loop which runs 4 times and takes 4 input. You have to store these inputs in an array, let's call that array A. Now after storing the information in an array, take the first element and the last element. 2+1 = 3 Take the second and second last element. 5+3 = 8 Now, here is the tricky part. You have to take the second last element and the second element. 3+5 = 8 And again, the last element and the first element. 1+2 = 3 So, now your output should be 3 8 8 3
