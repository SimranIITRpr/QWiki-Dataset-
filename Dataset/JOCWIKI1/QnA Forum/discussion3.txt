list with user input

‪Anu (talkcontribs)‬
‪Can anyone please explain with simple example/syntax the outline for inputting a value into a list where all the inputs are on the same line. eg: input : 1 2 3 4 5 6 also how to avoid list index exceed error. Please I need help! A simple code will help me understand it better. I've searched multiple places/forums but couldn't find an answer. Maybe it's discussed in some video lecture which I'm unable to recall or locate.Please help! I'm already late as I've messed up two of my assignments because of this...‬

as we are randomly choosing a word from the definition ,there is fair chance that the same word is asked as a question by the computer (neglecting the jumbled order)......is there a way that a word choosen once shouldnt be taken for the further randomisations?

NEED HELP WITH SPYDER
6 comments • ‪4 months ago‬



‪Jenishlythomas (talkcontribs)‬
‪I am facing problem with "Spyder IDE", It was working smoothly after Acononda3 installation for past two weeks and i was able to use it without any problem.‬
‪However,for past 3 days whenever i try to open Spyder it opens with a blank black screen, the cursor changes when i hover the screen, all the functionalities remains the same, right click shows Spyder related options but its just that the UI is not visible, there is only blank black screen. screetshot encl.‬
‪I surfed online for solution and tried out options like, uninstalling & reinstalling Anaconda3, reseting Spyder & starting it again but noting seems to be working.‬
‪Any help or advice on the said issue would be of great help.‬

Doubt on Wisdom of Crowd !
7 comments • ‪4 months ago‬



‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪So, I was after I watched the video - Crowd Computing - Just estimate 02, I stumbled upon a question.‬
‪Is the crowd's collective opinion always better than an expert opinion ? I mean the crowd doesn't consist of specialists to the specefic problem we are dealing with, while an expert would have gone through such problems before, since it might be his field.‬
‪However, the music example clearly made sense on how powerful the wisdom of crowd is.‬
‪My doubt is - had we asked a mathematician about the number of gems, how do we know, his guess wouldn't have been close to 375 ?‬
‪Another question that came to me was - Most of us are familiar with Kaun Banega CrorePati (KBC) - In the program, when the player requests for audience pole, more than 90% of the times the answer with the majority is correct.‬
‪However, when the questions starts getting tougher, the audience pole doesn't give a clear winner and often the majority (slightly more than other options ) is wrong. While the opinion of expert (expert's advice) is correct.‬
‪Please justify the Crowd computing in the above 2 scenarios !‬

‪4 months ago‬


‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪I thhink wisdom of crows doesnt work with unknow topics. Loke KBC people cant ans the question via pole bcz question is tough and they dont know the ans.‬
‪But in the jar case as we see in video. People able to judge the number of gems. Bcz our mind id familier with size of jar it volume. Like if we have a bucket we can guess its volume bcz data is stored in our mind. We compare the current bucket with stored data and we get appro answer. But if you ask same question a who know counting but never encounter bucket and its size shape or volume. I am sure you will get wrong answer.‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Simmi (talkcontribs)‬
‪Well, first of all we can't rely on these reality TV shows. Yes wisdom of crowds has its limitations. To the best of my knowledge it works the best in case of estimation problems.‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪My next question would be - Why does it actually work ? I mean we take 100 people and ask them to 'randomly guess' and like magic, the inputs they gave approximately is correct. While if we had asked an expert, he would have tried to maybe approximate something called a logical estimation. At that point if the expert fails to answer correctly, we can always ponder what part of his logical estimation was wrong. Then rectify it to get to the correct estimation.‬
‪But what is the science behind the wisdom of crowd, I mean how are 100 random guesses aggregating to an approximately correct answer.‬
‪Over-estimates and underestimates cancel each other, but doesn't it mean that, all those inputs that under-estimated or over-estimated were simply a waste ? Even when we find out the trimmed mean, we actually delete the large parts of in-accurate estimations, which were simply wild guesses.‬
‪So if we were to compare 100 guesses from an expert (as there wouldn't be any wild guesses) , to that of 100 guesses of common people who are making random guesses, I feel, the 100 guesses from expert would yield better results. Please explain, why I would be wrong, or what is the loophole in the above scenario ?‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Simmi (talkcontribs)‬
‪This question has been explained in the videos. Why the trimmed mean of all the guesses result in correct value?‬

‪If the correct value is 100 and a person guesses 120, then his overestimation value is 20. Why would it be a waste?‬
‪Please try to run this experiment (expert one) and let me know the results.‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪The explanation in the video tells us to trim the values because it negates the wild guesses that people made, which wouldn't make sense anyway to have in our data. I wanted to know something else, which I somehow justified by my own and got the answer !‬
‪Also by 100 I meant 100 number of guesses by the experts. I was calling values like '2000', '1800' and other similar largely over-estimated values which we trimmed off as a waste ! Since we never accounted for them and it was logically right thing to do.‬
‪My original question was, what if we asked 100 experts, I don't think there would be such wild guesses and hence might not need trimmed mean which we had to use to make the answer more approximate.‬
‪I would definitely try to run the experiment with experts and try to post the results !‬
‪Edit - Is it possible to download the lecture notes as PDF after a particular week is over ? I would love to have an offline copy of the notes in case my internet stops working..‬

file.close()
2 comments • ‪4 months ago‬



‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪So apparently I wrote down the following code -‬
‪  with open("abc.txt") as f:‬
      print("Hello")
      print(f.read())
  print("Bye")
  print(f.read())    
Which gave an error - ValueError: I/O operation on closed file.
‪So my question is, do we actually need to use f.close() in the above program ? Because according to the error I received I am assuming that anything after the indented code is over, the spyder IDE automatically closes the file ?‬

‪in my code when the input is 1 4 output actually should be 2 3 4 but it is like 1 2 3 y can anybody figure it out my code is list_1=[] for i in range(50): list_1.append(i) a, b=input().split() a=int(a) b=int(b) for i in range(a,b) print(list_1[i])‬

‪Edited 4 months ago‬



‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪In the statement, for i in range(50): i starts from 0 to 50. So to start i from 1, use the code below for i in range(1,51): Also I used 51 because you need to have 50 in the list, which means you need to write 51 as it includes end number - 1 ! This should solve the issue !‬

Crowd computing by akhilswaminathan@gmail.com
3 comments • ‪4 months ago‬



‪Simmi (talkcontribs)‬
‪concept of crowd wisdom is fake? (show original) Aug 26 i doubt the concept of wisdom of crowds. today i was watching a kannada show in tv called sixth sense. concept of the show is pretty simple, there will be about 100 boxes containing different amounts of money. the contestant had to open one box after the other,the last box that's finally left unopened belongs to contestant. i.e. the money in it completely belongs to contestent. So today there was a celebrity she had two boxes, box 4 and 5 uponed at last. one of them containing 1lakh bucks and the other containing 10lakh bucks. she wanted 10lakhs,she took opinion from almost 3 people (the show host,her co star, her brother), apart from her all of them recommended her to open 5 and keep 4, so according to crowd computing this option should be right. she went along with the crowd but she lost 10 lakh .:(‬

‪hi, i believe the show you have watched based on the monty hall problem. well most of the game shows are based on this you can refer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem, wisdom of crowd is different , you have to take each value into account and as explained by the good TA's in the videos you have to get average mean etc., but the game show is based on probability.‬

‪You are getting 2 number extra because you are including 0 and you are not excluding number by which you are dividing. Which is requirement of program. Means you have to exclude "a" while dividing.(assume, a= 5 in your code. Then you have to exclude 5/5 and 0/5) Hope you understand...‬

‪Hi I just figured it out. Break statement comes out of only one while loop. While the program exits from the inner while loop, it continues to interate on the outer while loop. So I replaced the inner while loop with if statement. Now it is working :) Please let me know if my understanding is correct.‬

‪Hi Sir, I am trying the call sort function inside print statement. I am getting the output as None. Why does this happen? Please find the below code. Estimate = [1,2,3,784,455,78,45,95,35,15,45,75] print(Estimate.sort())‬

‪5 months ago‬



‪Simmi (talkcontribs)‬
‪sort function sorts the list in place and does not return a new list. So you have to print Estimate separately.‬

‪If you print the list directly (print(list)), then you will get output like [2,3,4,5]. But if you use a for loop to print an item present in the list separately then it will be printed in newline.‬

Why should we define a function?
3 comments • ‪5 months ago‬



‪Abhijeet.khanderao (talkcontribs)‬
‪In the FIzzBuzz part 2, it was suggested to always define a function. I'm a little confused. What is a function? How and where we should use it? I did notice that it made the program more flexible.‬

‪5 months ago‬



‪Simmi (talkcontribs)‬
‪Function divides your programming in different chunks. It increases the modularity of the program. In case your program uses same code snippet again and again, use functions for the particular code snippet. It saves time and is easy to rectify.‬

Need Help on Printing
4 comments • ‪5 months ago‬



‪Pranav24b (talkcontribs)‬
‪Hi, I Thought of a code to include random function and the idea I came up with was a loading indicator display. The code I wrote is as bleow: <nowiki>#Loading Indicator import random import time import sys def tempo(): tm=[] for x in range (1,5): x=str(x) tm.append(x) tm.append(str(int(x)-1)) for c in range (0,15): c=str(c) tm.append(c) t=random.choice(tm) t=int(t)/10 return t #two loops = higher probability of lower numbers in array for i in range (1,101): indicat=i*0.5 indicat=int(indicat)#indicator on alternate increment in percentage print ('Loading_',i,"%",'|'*indicat," \r",end='') sys.stdout.flush() time.sleep(tempo()) print(" \r",end='')</nowiki> So it works fine except that I had imagined the indicator to be on the next line. Is there a way to achieve that without printing the percentage indicator line again? TL DR?: Need a method to replace the last two lines while printing inside a loop.‬

‪For changing the scale of x axis, write plt.axes.Axes.set_xscale(1, 'linear'). Here you can write log, symlog etc in place of linear. You can draw bargraphs with the help of plt.bar()‬

In the for loop, a new line is automatically added after the last element. How to remove the same to pass without presentation error? Do the presentation errors matter while grading?‬
