Hi guys ....I wrote code for magic square as it is in tutorial ...when I give 3 it is showing right output...but when I give 4 for 4x4 matrix it is showing "index out of range error"...plz check my code and tell what is the mistake in my code. CODE IS HERE: def magic_square(n):

magicSquare = []

for i in range(n): l = [] for j in range(n): l.append(0) magicSquare.append(l)

i = n//2 j = n-1

num = n*n count = 1

while(count <= num): if(i==-1 and j==n): j = n-2 i = 0 else: if(j==n): j = 0 if(i<0): i = n-1 if(magicSquare[i][j] != 0): j = j-2 i = i+1 continue else: magicSquare[i][j] = count count+= 1 i = i-1 j = j+1

for i in range(n): for j in range(n): print(magicSquare[i][j],end=" ") print() x = int(input("enter")) magic_square(x)

Hi...Bro when I enter 3 as input it is showing 3x3 magic square...but when I enter 4 as input ..the program not executing.The error is "index of out of range". I could not find solutions...just copy my code and run it in your PC you can understand. Thank you..

    magicsquare[i][j] = count
    I set n = 3 and your "j" is getting value -4. As this is 3*3 matrix so there is no element at j = -4
    You need to work again on this program and fix issues with it.

you have to create a list with a range. which should be first input of your programme. than insert the elements in that list which your step by step input to the range. than sort it. than print the elements of that list which is sorted in one line

Reply 2 months ago
Rmanish (talkcontribs)
means see in the assignment the first input is range. for example let the first input is a=3 then by using loop create a list which can store only 3 elements. for create a ranged list at first you have to create a empty list than put it into for or while loop which's range should be the first input (a). then next inputs are elements of list.

yes, randomly select 2 indexes and swap the values at those indexes. Then check whether list is sorted or not. If not, repeat the swap and so on..

Hi All, Just a small concern in regard to this 'Assignment 3 of Week 4'. I have already programmed with the logic as per the requirements provided in the assignment but some strange things are happening while I'm clicking the 'Compile & Run' button on the assignment page. Sometimes Test Cases 1 and 4 are showing as 'Passed' and at the same time Test Cases 2 and 3 are showing as 'Time Limit Exceeded'

Reply 2 months ago
Indrag79 (talkcontribs)
Also, even sometimes all the Test Cases 1, 2, 3 and 4 are showing as 'Time Limit Exceeded'. Does anyone have any idea exactly what is happening here? Any sort of help in this regard is highly appreciated. Thank you in advance

Reply 2 months ago
Indrag79 (talkcontribs)
Just for your information, the random selection of the indexes has been done via 'random.randint' function after importing the random library. Rest of all said things in the question have been taken into account accordingly.

Reply 2 months ago
Sachinkr (talkcontribs)
Little logic behind this program is. While swapping, you have to check which one is greater. do we really need swapping to sort my list?

Reply 2 months ago
Indrag79 (talkcontribs)
Thanks Sachin! Actually, that logic has also been checked properly. In fact, after each swap all the elements of the list are checked accordingly in case which one is greater or smaller than the other and then proceed for the ascending order of the elements. Still trying to figure out and get rid of that "Time Limit Exceeded" error by trying to make some alterations in my algorithm.

Reply 2 months ago
Ashuditya (talkcontribs)
it's because of one of the loops, if your using while loop check if you have give increment statement or not.

Reply 2 months ago
Indrag79 (talkcontribs)
Thanks everyone! I have resolved the issue "Time Limit Exceeded" by making some changes at the code level. Now the program is running fine by taking all the criteria as mentioned in the assignment into consideration.

Reply 2 months ago
Indrag79 (talkcontribs)
Despite of the exit condition of while loop (a boolean condition was used in while statement) being taken into account, the program was still showing "Time Limit Exceeded" issue. So after making some changes at the code level, my program is now running fine. The logic behind my earlier program wasn't incorrect as two of the test cases out of four had already passed but still two leftover cases weren't crossing the "Passed" mark until I had to dig inside for some code level changes.

sometimes it is the while loop that start behaving as infinite loop, its not an error as viewed from interpreter but on portal you need to output answer in given time.

Question asked by Shivam Arora

Reply 2 months ago
Simmi (talkcontribs)
It is used to execute related operations. For example: in file handling if we have to write in the file, we first have to open the file. So in order to execute this pair of instructions, we should use with block.

Reply 2 months ago
ShivamArora (talkcontribs)
What do you mean by related operations?

Also, can I use it with other streams like URL connections?

And, what happens if I don't use the with block and try to read the file without with block?

Reply 2 months ago
Simmi (talkcontribs)
By related operations, i meant the operations that must be executed in sequence in order to achieve the desired result. For example, writing in a file. For that, you must open the file first.

Reply 2 months ago
Simmi (talkcontribs)
You can also read the file without with block. You can use it for URL as well as database connections

with block helps in reducing errors as it automatically completes the mandatory practices like closing a file or commiting changes to DB after exiting it.

Two clear reasons:<br> 1. not removing space after last element in row.<br> 2. not removing extra newline after last row. <br>Printing on spyder doesn't mean its right, you need to fulfill output requirements asked on portal.

Pranjalis2709, if your program is running on spyder, it means you're right. Be positive. But NPTEL is having its own syntax and output checking program on its portal, and that way ONLY it gives us error or score. So you need to take care of ONLY the following things as said by Bhaveshbhai too. i.e. 1. remove extra space and new line if there, after last element in row 2. remove extra space and new line if there, after any output line

You have to take Input in one line only then separate the elements using list(). *But print(for debug purpose) the list before doing further operation. As list will contain " " (space as element). *Here list element will be string. So designed your program accordingly.

Use "DRY" practices, while writing code. Think twice, code once. Always use pen and paper to figure out what are you asked to do and then how are you going to do it. Never just jump and start coding.<br>And if you are still thinking whats "DRY" meant? <b>D</b>on't <b>R</b>eapeat <b>Y</b>ourself.

Copy of ascii_letters
4 comments â€¢ 2 months ago
Krishna Mahadevaiah (talkcontribs)
Hi Simran, I have some confusion regarding spot the similarity program. When I copy the ascii_letters to a variable symbols=string.ascii_letters and then I call x=random.choice(symbols) , I am able to get a random selection in x. Next I try to remove the selection from the variable symbols.remove(x), I get a error saying â€˜'str' object has no attribute 'remove'â€™. So I figured it out that to remove a selection, it is only possible to remove it from the list. So I changed my initial copy of ascii_letters to a list symbols=list(string.ascii_letters), now I am able to call and remove the random selection. My question is how is the random.choice works in the first case where I have copied the ascii_letters to variable x. Initial Case where random selection works, but remove function fails import string, random symbols=string.ascii_letters x=random.choice(symbols) print(x) #here I am getting the random selection. How is this working? This is my question? symbols.remove(x) #i get the error as â€˜'str' object has no attribute 'remove'â€™ print(symbols) Second Case where the random selection and remove function works import string, random symbols=list(string.ascii_letters) x=random.choice(symbols) print(x) symbols.remove(x) print(symbols) Could you please help me on this?

Hi Krishna,<br> Short Answer:<br> Strings are non-mutable data type while List is a mutable data type.<br> Long Answer:<br> See first of all string class does not have any remove() method so its obvious to show error. The reason why it doesn't have such a method is the point i think you are asking about. If it had such method the string will change and it will not remain non-mutable.<br>While lists are mutable, they posses such function and change themselves by removing the element. <h6>Now coming to random selection part.</h6> <pre>Random.choice(sequence)</pre> Return a random element from the non-empty sequence. If sequence is empty, raises IndexError. And both list and string are sequence so it works with that.But one is mutable so has remove function and other is not so it doesn't.<br> Try this:<br> Try passing an integer value instead of sequence in random.choice and see the error message. <br><br> I hope this will clear your doubt and if not ask again, we are all here to help you.

You must be using nested loops. In 2nd loop, create conditional statement. like as follow: if last element print(matrix, end="") else print(matrix) or print(matrix, end= " ")

<h1>For every one finding it difficult for Assignment 1 week 4</h1> In python the print function has a parameter called 'end'. Use it for better and ease of code. like print(stringtobeprinted,end=""), will not add new line automatically, or end=" " will give extra space after end in same line.

From the official documentation:<pre> print(object(s),separator=separator, end=end, file=file,flush=flush) </pre><br> object(s)=Any object, and as many as you like. Will be converted to string before printed<br><br> sep='separator'	Optional. Specify how to separate the objects, if there is more than one. Default is ''<br><br> end='end' Optional. Specify what to print at the end. Default is '\n' (line feed)<br><br> file Optional. An object with a write method. Default is sys.stdout<br><br> flush Optional.

No, but you must write import statement before using the library functions.

Bhavesh (talkcontribs)
from stackoverflow: Module importing is quite fast, but not instant. This means that: Putting the imports at the top of the module is fine, because it's a trivial cost that's only paid once. Putting the imports within a function will cause calls to that function to take longer. So if you care about efficiency, put the imports at the top.

Magic Square Code and Explanation

added python code for Magic square. Has explanation and Tested inputs for same code too. First i directly edited the main page but i think mentors should verify it and then add it by themselves.

<pre> def magicsquareit(n): box=[] for i in range(0,n): res=[] for j in range(0,n): res.append(0) box.append(res) row=n//2 col=n-1 maxdigit= (n**2)+1 for i in range(1,maxdigit): box[row][col] = i if(i==maxdigit-1): break row,col=findposition(n,row,col,box) finalmagicstring="" for i in box: stringrow="" for j in i: stringrow=stringrow+str(j)+" " stringrow.strip() stringrow=stringrow+"\n" finalmagicstring=finalmagicstring+stringrow return(finalmagicstring) def findposition(n,row,col,box): row=row-1 col=col+1 flagtochecckifempty=0 while(flagtochecckifempty==0): if(row==-1 and col==n): row=0 col=n-2 elif(row==-1): row=n-1 elif(col==n): col=0 if(box[row][col]==0): flagtochecckifempty = 1 else: row = row + 1 col = col - 2 return (row,col) n=int(input()) if(n>0): if(n%2==0): print("Magic Square is not possible for even number.") else: sum=(n*((n**2)+1))//2 print(magicsquareit(n)) print("Sum is ",sum) else: print("Enter positive numbers only") </pre> Explanation: Here input is taken as an int.Then input is checked for being only positive odd integer. It is then passed to function magicsquareit().Inside this function, a 2-d array or say nested list with all elements equal to zero is initialised. Then a for loop is being used to find position of numbers from 1 to n^2(ex: 9 for n=3). The function findposition returns the valid position of number and sets that position equal to it. The findposition function works according to the algorithm stated above. After this, an empty string is initialised to return the result in proper format. Tested Inputs <pre> Input: 1 Output: 1 Sum is 1 Input: 2 Output: Magic Square is not possible for even number. Input: 3 Output: 2 7 6 9 5 1 4 3 8 Sum is 15 Input: -1 Output: Enter positive numbers only Input: 9 Output: 35 25 15 5 76 66 56 46 45 24 14 4 75 65 55 54 44 34 13 3 74 64 63 53 43 33 23 2 73 72 62 52 42 32 22 12 81 71 61 51 41 31 21 11 1 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 9 80 59 49 39 29 19 18 8 79 69 48 38 28 27 17 7 78 68 58 37 36 26 16 6 77 67 57 47 Sum is 369 </pre>

Hi, I tried implementing it without watching the solution and instead of using 'continue' logic explained, I ended up using break statement (and some other changes too). One motive of this is to share the different way to implement this and other is to ask for some comments from the performance perspective so that going onward we will keep those things in mind while writing code. Thanks. def magicsquare(): n=input('Enter the value of n(odd number) for n*n magic square: ') n=int(n) #create an empty list ms = [[0 for x in range(n)] for y in range(n)] p=int(n/2) #rule1 q=n-1 #rule1 #define 1 ms[p][q] = 1 for i in range(2,n*n+1): p=p-1 q=q+1 if(p!=-1 and q!=n and ms[p][q]==0): ms[p][q] = i else: while(1): if(p==-1 and q==n): p,q = 0,n-2 #rule 5: if row=-1 and col = n, make it (0,n-2) if(p!=-1 and q!=n and ms[p][q]==0): break if(p==-1): p = n-1 #rule 3: if the position becomes -1, make it n-1 if(p!=-1 and q!=n and ms[p][q]==0): break if(q==n): q=0 #rule 2: if the position becomes n, make it 0 if(p!=-1 and q!=n and ms[p][q]==0): break if(ms[p][q] != 0): p,q = p+1,q-2 if(p!=-1 and q!=n and ms[p][q]==0): break ms[p][q] = i print(ms)

Very good, that you have written this on your own.<br> Two points i want to raise for your solution for better performance. <ul> <li>Replace the 5th line with "p=n//2" as in python division has to done with care. '/' means float division and '//' means integer division.</li> <li>In the for loop you are taking upper value as n*n +1, replace it with a variable that already had the computed value, like store N=n*n +1 before that for loop and then use N in loop.<br>This will reduce the calculation every time loop runs because now in each iteration loop checks the upper limit and for that it has to calculate n*n +1, everytime. By doing this, the program will only need to calculate it once.</li> </ul> <br>Rest is already good. Keep it up.

Doblble Game
3 comments â€¢ 2 months ago
Feroz Ahamed (talkcontribs)
Let's Program and Play by Feroz Ahamed "Programming isn't about what you know, it's about what you can figure out" - Chris Pine Mario , Angry Birds , Candy Crush are some of the most played games we know about . Let's see if we can build games by using Python . So let's create a game ! Dobble Game - Spot the similarity 01 by Feroz Ahamed Dobble is a simple pattern recognition game in which players try to find an image shown on two cards. Each card in Dobble features eight different symbols, with the symbols varying in size from one card to the next. Any two cards have exactly one symbol in common. For the basic Spot it! game, reveal one card, then another. Whoever spots the symbol in common on both cards claims the first card, then another card is revealed for players to search, and so on. Whoever has collected the most cards when the 55-card deck runs out wins! Dobble Game - Spot the similarity 02 by Feroz Ahamed The rules of the game were already discussed in the previous section.To recall what the game is all about - In this game , there are around 50 cards from which one person flashes two cards, the other person should spot the common symbol or object present in both the cards just as shown in the image below . Dobble Game - Spot the similarity 03 by Feroz Ahamed Though this game appears to be simple , it is actually not ! Let's see if we can implement this game in Python . We shall use Alphabets instead of objects in the python version of the game for the time being and the basic rules must be followed even while making the python version of the game .Those are - all the cards should have definite number of symbols and only one symbol/Alphabet should be common for any pair of cards. For example : If we assume two cards having symbols/Alphabets as shown: "ABGTFC" --- "TJYPOL" In this pair of cards we clearly see that both the cards have definite number of symbols (Here, in this case - 6 in both the cards) and there is only one alphabet common in both the cards and that is - "T". Dobble Game - Spot the similarity 04 by Feroz Ahamed As this game involves only Alphabets and symbols , we shall use the string module by first importing it ,also we shall be using the random module in this program as shown: import string import random print(string.ascii_letters) If we compile and run the above program we get something as shown : abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ i.e we get a to z lower case letters followed by upper case letters. We shall now make a list of symbols as shown below: symbols = [] symbols = list(string.ascii_letters) Then make two cards - card1 and card2: card1 = [] card2 = [] And let the number of symbols or alphabets in any card is restricted to 5 . To do that we shall code it as : card1 = [0]*5 card2 = [0]*5 Then we have to find the position of the same symbol in card1 as well as card2 : pos1 = random.randint(0,4) pos2 = random.randint(0,4) Here pos1 and pos2 are the same symbol positions in card 1 and card 2 respectively . Now that we are done with the positions , we shall have a character named samesymbol and it should be randomly choosed from the "symbols" list . The code is to be completed as shown below: samesymbol=random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(samesymbol) if(pos1==pos2): card1[pos1] = samesymbol card2[pos2] = samesymbol else: card1[pos1] = samesymbol card2[pos2] = samesymbol card1[pos2] = random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(card1[pos2]) card2[pos1] = random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(card2[pos1]) i=0 while(i<5): if(i!=pos1 and i!=pos2): alphabet1=random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(alphabet1) alphabet2=random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(alphabet2) card1[i]=alphabet1 card2[i]=alphabet2 i=i+1 print(card1) print(card2) ch = input("Ask the user to spot the similar symbol - ") if (ch==samesymbol): print("Right") else: print("Wrong") Dobble Game - Complete Code by Feroz Ahamed import string import random i = 0 symbols = [] symbols = list(string.ascii_letters) card1 = [0]*5 card2 = [0]*5 pos1 = random.randint(0,4) pos2 = random.randint(0,4) samesymbol=random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(samesymbol) if(pos1==pos2): card1[pos1] = samesymbol card2[pos2] = samesymbol else: card1[pos1] = samesymbol card2[pos2] = samesymbol card1[pos2] = random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(card1[pos2]) card2[pos1] = random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(card2[pos1]) while(i<5): if(i!=pos1 and i!=pos2): alphabet1=random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(alphabet1) alphabet2=random.choice(symbols) symbols.remove(alphabet2) card1[i]=alphabet1 card2[i]=alphabet2 i=i+1 print(card1) print(card2) ch = input("Ask the user to spot the similar symbol-") if (ch==samesymbol): print("Right") else: print("Wrong") Output : ['s', 'W', 'g', 'f', 'M'] ['k', 'M', 'E', 'X', 'u'] Ask the user to spot the similar symbol-M Right ['Y', 'w', 'e', 'C', 'z'] ['Z', 'C', 'P', 's', 'k'] Ask the user to spot the similar symbol-Z Wrong

Hi, just a add on to the above mentioned code. In the symbol list, we have all the alphabets in upper and lower case. So in the card1 or card2 or both, you might get something like 'a' and 'A'. To avoid this, define symbol as : symbol = list(set(string.ascii_letters.lower())) or symbol = list(string.ascii_letters) symbol = symbol[0:len(symbol)//2]

In start there will same number of blanks as the number of letters in movie name, '#' represents the space in movie name if present.<br><br> <strong>Rules of the game</strong><br> <ul> <li>Player can guess only one letter at a time</li> <li>Player only need to guess letters in movie name, spaces and numbers are already shown.(spaces with '#')</li> <li>Player has to guess all the letters in atmost 10 moves</li> <li>No moves will be deducted if correctly guessed, but will lose 1 move for every wrong guess.</li> </ul> So come, Let's Play!<br> Note: Copy and Paste the below code into your IDE and save it as .py file, then run the file by double-clicking on it.<br><br> <strong>Code for the game</strong><br> <pre> import random import os def create_ques_string(movie): a=movie.split() qstring="" for i in a: b="" for j in i: if(j=='*'): b=b+'_' else: b=b+" "+j+" " qstring=qstring+b.strip()+" " return qstring.strip() movielist=["Avengers Infinity War","Dhadak","Inception","Kai Po Che","Jungle Book","Thor Ragnarok","Iron Man","Civil War","Deadpool","Notebook","Dr Strange","Life of Pi"] movie=random.choice(movielist) movie=movie.replace(" ","#") queslist=list(movie) queslistset=set(queslist) solve=1 queslistcustom=[] for i in range(0,len(queslist)): if(queslist[i]=='#'): queslistcustom.append(queslist[i]) else: queslistcustom.append(' * ') stringtobeprinted="".join(queslistcustom) moves=10 while(1): try: queslistset.remove('#') except(KeyError): break while(solve==1 and moves>0): os.system('cls') print(create_ques_string(stringtobeprinted)) x=input("\nMoves Left: "+str(moves)+"\nGUESS THE NEXT LETTER : ") found=1 if(x.lower() in queslistset or x.upper() in queslistset ): for i in range(0,len(queslist)): if(queslist[i]==x.lower() or queslist[i]==x.upper() ): queslistcustom[i]=queslist[i] queslistset.discard(queslist[i]) found=0 stringtobeprinted="".join(queslistcustom) print(create_ques_string(stringtobeprinted)) if(len(queslistset)==0): solve=0 else: print("\nWrong Guess!! or Already guessed! ",end="") moves=moves-1 if(solve==0): print("\n\nSolved!!! in",10-moves,"moves") else: print("\nNo moves left\nYou Lose!\n") input() </pre> <br> <strong>Explanation of code</strong><br>(Don't edit the variable names, by mistaking them as typing error)<br> A list of sample movies is created in, as movielist.Then we choose a random moviename by the use of Random module and store that moviename into movie variable. Then as per game requireement we replace all the whitespaces in movie name by '#', using string function replace().<br> Now we create three variables as queslist, this is a list of all letters used in movie name , queslistset, this is a set of all unique letters used in moviename and queslistcustom, this is very important as it is being used to generate new string to be displayed everytime.<br> We then make queslistcustom such that it contains '*' for every letter in movie name and '#' for spaces by using a for loop. Then we convert this queslistcustom to string by join() method and pass it to our create_ques_string function. This function is used to make pretty printing on the screen, so as to make users experience better, it returns a string with dashes('_') and spaces.<br> Now comes the main part, as told above we have queslistset variable, containing all the unique letters present in the movie name. We use the input letter to check whether it is present in the set or not. If it is present we use another for loop to find all its position in the movie name string and at the same time we append that letter into our queslistcustom variable and remove it from the queslistset. <strong>Note that we are using discard() method instead of remove(), because it doesn't throw error if the to be removed element was not present, while the latter does.</strong><br> Then we again pass the edited queslistcustom to be pretty printed for screen with all dashes and spaces at required place. We continue to do so either when solve==0 or moves becomes 0. The input() in the end is used to pause the screen so as player can see his/her result<br> <strong>Two things used here for enhancing game experience :</strong><br> <ul> <li>Using os module, for clearing the screen after every input, os.system('cls') is used for windows. [https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html Read more here]</li> <li>As iwe know about the error throwing nature of remove function of set, we utilize it. Using try,except block for removing '#'s from the movielistset, so as we can check condition that length of set is 0 or not to break out of loop.

what is scripting language? is python a scripting language?

Simmi (talkcontribs)
Scripting languages are those languages which don't require compilation and are only interpreted. Compiler translates the entire program to machine language at once but interpreter does it line by line. Now you figure out and tell me whether Python is a scripting language or not??

Python is scripting language. is right?

As simmi told, try writing intentionally an error but before that put some valid correct print() statements. When you will run this, you will observe that those print statements have run successfully and then the console shows error. If it had been with compiled language the program would not have been run from line 1 itself. Try running this: <pre> print("I am line 1") print("I am line 2") print("I am line 3") printtt("I will give error") print("I am OK but i will not run") </pre>

yeah it is happen bhavesh. only first three print statement has executed and after some error get displayed.

Week 4 Magic square
Bhavesh (talkcontribs)
Can anyone explain why only this algorithm works in case of Magic Square question. Like why do we need to follow only these steps or from where one could deduce these steps on their own. Like some derivation or some generalisation. <br> I think its good that we know the algorithm but it would be better to know its formulation and approach to reach at this algorithm. <br> Anyone please share your thoughts or ideas regarding this.

Birthday Paradox - Find your twin Notes

Summary by Bhavesh
First commit, wrote the lecture notes for Week 4, Birthday paradox. About, Explanation and complete code with explanation.

<h1>About</h1> <p>This is a paradox about sharing same birth dates among a given group of people. It goes like this "in a room of 23 people, you have 50% chances of sharing birthday with other person, while in a room of 70 people you have 99% chances of sharing birthday with other person!".</p> [[File:bparadox.png|1800px]] <h3>Why is it so ?</h3> Everyone wants to know how is this possible.Going by theoretical approach, it is quite clear that we must need atleast 364/365 people in a room to have common birthdays but....<br>this is why this paradox is so popular.<br>The probability of having same birthday can be seen as:<br><h4><i>P(same)=1-P(not_same)</i></h4>. Now this probability increases <strong><i>exponentially</i></strong> as we increase the number of people. Learn more on wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem <h1>Code:</h1> Note: We will be using random module for generating random integers.Learn more on wiki: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_number_generation <pre> import random def check_leap(year): if(year%4==0 and ((year%100==0 and year%400==0) or year%100!=0)): return True return False def birthday_paradox(n): set_container_to_check_if_matched=set() l=len(set_container_to_check_if_matched) for i in range(0,n): random_month=random.randint(1,12) if(random_month==2): random_year=random.randint(1990,2019) if(check_leap(random_year)): random_day=random.randint(1,29) #Leap Year and February else: random_day=random.randint(1,28) #Not Leap and February else: random_year=random.randint(1990,2019) if(random_month%2): if(random_month<7): random_day=random.randint(1,30) #April June else: random_day=random.randint(1,31) # August October December else: if(random_month<=7): random_day=random.randint(1,31) #January March May july else: random_day=random.randint(1,30) #September November random_birthdate=str(random_day)+str(random_month) #add str(random_year here to simulate for exact same birthdates.) set_container_to_check_if_matched.add(random_birthdate) #add the string to set, if already present its length won't change. if(len(set_container_to_check_if_matched)!=l): l=len(set_container_to_check_if_matched) else: print("Found a match after asking ",l," people\nMatched BirthDate is: ",str(random_day)+"/"+str(random_month)) return print("No common birthdates were found, Try increasing the count.") n=int(input("Enter the number of people you want to ask their Birthdays! : ")) birthday_paradox(n) </pre> <h3>Explanation of Code</h3> In this an integer is taken as number of people you want to ask. Then we generate random day,month & year for each iteration as it is the random birth date of person.<br><br> Here to check whether we have a match, one can use "set", an inbuilt data type in python. What set does is, it only contains or allows to add distinct elements in it. So after creating the random birth date, when we add the string to set, if already present its length won't change and we break out of the loop, printing "It's a match" and number of people asked as length of set. If it changes its length that means the string was new and distinct till now, so we just add it and repeat the process till loop ends.<br> If loop ends and still no match was there, we simply print to increase the number of people asked. <pre>Note: Copy and paste above program to run on your machine and check the correctness of paradox.</pre>

Magic Square Hit and Trial 1
One comment â€¢ 2 months ago
Feroz Ahamed (talkcontribs)
In this section , we shall be dealing with a square divided into smaller squares each containing a number, such that the figures in each vertical, horizontal, and diagonal row add up to the same value . Normally a magic square of 2*2 is not possible which is the only exception , so to start with if we assume a 3x3 square then the sum of the elements must be equal to 15 in any direction - either it be vertical or horizontal or diagonal . Generally for a n*n square , the value to which the sum should be equal to is called Magic Constant and is given by M = n.(nÂ²+1)/2 . Here for n = 3 , M =3.(9+1)/2 which is equal to 15 . Some ways of arranging the elements in a 3*3 square to get a sum of 15 : 816 618 276 357 753 951 492 294 438 ... To solve these squares , there are few facts one must know : 1.In any magic square 1 is located at (n/2,n-1). 2.If position of 1 is now taken as(p,q) then the position of 2 is at (p-1,q+1).And if anytime calculated row position becomes -1 then make it n-1 and if column position becomes 0 then make it n. 3.If the calculated position already contains a number then decrement the column by 2 and increment the row by 1 . 4.If anytime row position becomes-1 and column becomes n switch to (0,n-2). So first lets solve a 3*3 square using the facts mentioned : Assume a 3*3 square as shown : x x x (00) (01) (02) x x x (10) (11) (12) x x x (20) (21) (22) Where "x" be the elements of the square and (ab) represents the element's position. The position of 1 should be at (3/2 = 1.5 -->1 , 3-1) = ( 1 , 2 ) Assume p = 1, q = 2. Position of 2 must be at new (p,q) = old(p-1,q+1) = (1-1,2+1) = (0,0) As 3>2 --> q = 0. Position of 3 must be at new(p,q) = old(p-1,q+1) = (0-1,0+1) = (-1,1) ---> (3-1 , 1 ) --> (2,1) (As p became -1 we have to replace it with n-1 , here in this case p = 3-1). Position of 4 must be at (p-1,q+1) = (1,2) but at (1,2) already 0 exists , so by fact 3 , (p,q) = (2,0). So in this way the whole squares are to be filled . We see that it takes a lot of time to solve it . So we shall see if a piece of code employing the facts can make us solve it faster .
