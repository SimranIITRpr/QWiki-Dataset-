WHY DATA INSUFFICIENT?
3 comments • ‪2 months ago‬



‪Amichoksi (talkcontribs)‬
‪Consider the secure Rock Paper Scissors game.‬

Assume for both the players:
0->Rock 
1->Paper
2 ->Scissors

Player 1's input : 1000010210 
Player 2's input : 1012010211

Who won?
 Player 1
 Player 2
 Draw
 Data insufficient and hence winner cannot be determined.

Accepted Answers:
Data insufficient and hence winner cannot be determined.

Unable to submit Programming Assignments of Week 5 and Week 6
6 comments • ‪3 months ago‬



‪Pythoncourse123 (talkcontribs)‬
‪The due date for Programming Assignments of Week 5 and 6 was 13th September. However, when I attempted the assignment, I wasn't able to submit my program. I could compile and run it and see the tests I passed.‬
‪But when I would click on the submit button, it would give me an error like --> couldn't connect to NPTEL.ac.in (something like this don't remember the exact error) I received this error when I attempted to submit around 12th of September, when unable to submit the assignments I contacted our course instructor who guided me to ask the question here.‬
‪Addition details --> I was able to edit my programs even after due date - 13th September, until 19th of September, when it locked me out and said "Due date exceeded". All my 6 programs never got submitted and I was unable to get the scores for them either !‬

Quiz Week 5

‪Why is the answer to question 1 option a? If an element is not present in an array, it will come to an end without printing anything unless otherwise specified. If nothing is mentioned, it should come to end without printing anything and should come to an end abruptly. Question: What happens when you search for 35 in the list [10,20,30,40,50]? Given answer: The program would handle the case by printing a suitable message that the element is not found Why isn't the answer: The program will abruptly come to an end without intimating anything to the user.‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Amichoksi (talkcontribs)‬
‪Himanshubhai, 35 is not available in list, you agree. so 30 or 40 cannot be returned. you must agree.‬
‪other option is, The program will abruptly come to an end without intimating anything to the user. I agree, program will abruptly come to the end, but it intimates user that 35 is not found in the list.‬
‪that's why only 1 option is left, and obviously we have to handle a particular case in programming.‬
‪Hope, it is fine now, for you.‬

‪Edited 4 months ago‬



‪HimanshuRattan (talkcontribs)‬
‪You are at the wrong page. Tell me what this will do when you try to find 35.‬
‪list=[10,20,30,40,50] x=int(input()) for i in range(len(list)):‬
‪   if(x==list[i]):‬
       print("Found")
Hope this helps. :)

‪Amichoksi (talkcontribs)‬
‪I am at right page of Assignment 5, question-1. It is not specified, that you have to write for loop. So it is assumed to use the standard functions of Python.‬
‪list=[10,20,30,40,50]‬
x=int(input())
print(list.index(x))


'''Output:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "testy.py", line 3, in <module>

‪  Summary From Your code which pass all test:‬

‪   import math‬
   n = int(input())
   x,y = 0,0
   for  i  in range(n):
     a,b = input().split(" ")
     if a == 'UP':
       y= y+int(b)
     elif a == "DOWN":
       y= y-int(b)
     elif a == "LEFT":
       x= x-int(b)
     elif a == "RIGHT":
       x= x+int(b)
   
   pos=(x**2)+(y**2)
   dist1 = math.sqrt(pos)
   print(round(dist1))

‪Note: It took almost 2 days to write a proper 1BMW and N Goats code. But i didnt give up, try to figure out mistakes and google if required. But didnt ask for such help. If you wanna learn programming, such issues should be handled out yourself. Because you learn more then anything while find-out issues in your own program. You can ask for Idea(Even though it should strike u first) but programming part should all yours.‬

‪dict is type in python, i.e. dictionary. dict_items specifies dictionary items, same as we are having dict_keys, specifies dictionary keys. Following example will clarify your doubt, dictionary = {1:2,2:3,3:4} print(dict) print(dictionary.items()) print(dictionary.keys()) ''' Output: <class 'dict'> dict_items([(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]) dict_keys([1, 2, 3]) '''‬

‪The 1st question of week5 quiz says that "<b>What happens when you search for 35 in the list [10,20,30,40,50]?</b>",<br>Please tell me does it mean to use 'in' operator or using index() method of list to find an element's index.<br> Because answer will be different in both cases. What does it meant exactly to "search" an element, i think we need to explicitly specify the way we want to search.‬

‪Bhavesh (talkcontribs)‬
‪Cheating means if i have had asked tell me the correct answer.<br>Read it again and properly, i am asking about which method has been referenced by the question, as there are more than one ways to search an element. If it has been explicitly mentioned, i would have not bothered you or anyone.<br><br> There is no explicit way to say, ok search this, we have to use methods or some ways, and if there are more than one , it should be mentioned or discussed, thats not cheating! and in exam hall too, we can clarify the question if any issue occur.‬

‪Thanks for replying mam, but list.index() gives value error if value is not present in list and it is .find() in strings that give -1 if element is not present.<br>But .index() in both lists and strings give ValueError.

‪1. First Open "Anaconda Prompt" you will find it on desktop or search in your PC 2.Then run command "sudo pip install SpeechRecognition" if its not work. Use "pip install SpeechRecognition" >>> It will download some files from internet and install (Internet connection required) 3. If pip installtion module is old >> It will ask to update and show you the command to run >> Run that command 4. Then you are done XD‬

‪Thanks Guys. The issue was with the pip itself. pip was not being identified by CMD. I had to add python as system environmental variable and get the python identified. Finally, I was able to install it. :)‬
