‪If it is having the infinite loop, it may happen. I too faced once the same problem, when by mistake i put infinite loop. Please check, else you may share your code. So we all people may be able to support you.‬

‪Hi I tried several times I'm unable to get it pls help. I'm attaching code also‬

‪n=input("")‬
‪n=int(n) c=0‬
‪s=0‬
‪while(n>0):‬
‪r=n%10‬
n=n/10
c=c+1
s=s+r
while(1):
‪if(c==1):‬
 print(s)
 break
else:
 c=0   
 while(n>0):
  r=n%10
  n=n/10
  c=c+1
  s=s+r

‪My piece of code has passed Test case 3 and 4 but it got error in Testcase 1 and 2..‬
‪Program code :---‬

‪list1=[]‬
‪list1=[int(n) for n in input().split()]‬
‪list1.reverse()‬
‪for i in list1:‬
‪   while(list1.count(i)>1):‬
      
         list1.pop(list1.index(i))
list1.reverse()
‪str=' '.join(str(x) for x in list1)‬
‪print(str)‬

‪Test Case 1 OP : Test Case 1 Wrong Answer Input Expected Output Actual Output 1 1 9 5 2 1 4 1 1 4 0 6 1 4 3 3 2 2 0 1 9 5 2 4 0 6 3 1 9 5 2 4 0 6 3 3\n‬

‪Testcase 2 OP: Input Expected Output Actual Output 8 0 4 5 4 2 6 1 7 1 4 8 8 5 8 0 2 2 5 7 8 0 4 5 2 6 1 7 8 0 4 5 2 6 1 7 0\n‬

after reverse list1 will be
[0, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 6, 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 9, 1]

In loop
First element >> I = 0 > Zero will be removed [2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 1, 6, 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 9, 1]
Second element>> I = 2 > both will be removed using while loop >> [3, 3, 4, 1, 6, 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 9, 1]
Third Element>>  I = 4 > 4 will be removed  >>> [3, 3, 1, 6, 0, 4, 1, 1, 4, 1, 2, 5, 9, 1]

As you can see 3 will be untouched. Bcz for loop incrementor move to third element.

‪just add numbers to a second list after checking if the number already exists in the second list... if not in list2.. list2.append(list1[i])‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Anu (talkcontribs)‬
‪list1=[]‬
‪list1.append(input("").split(" "))‬
‪for i in range(len(list1)):‬
‪for j in range(i+1,len(list1)-1):‬
 if(list1[i]==list1[j]):
  list1[j]=list1[j+1]
for i in range(len(list1)-1):
‪print(list1[i])‬



‪I tried this code but im not getting the desired output please help. My logic says this, if we encounter a duplicate of list1[ i ] in list1[j] then we overwrite the the list1[j] value with the adjacent right hand side value.‬
‪We then print n-1 one elements of the list as last one second last elements will be the same. So we avoid the last element.‬
‪But I'm not getting any output after accepting value please help.‬

‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪Suppose = list1 = [1,2,2,2,3,4,4,5]‬
when you reached index 2 and you notice "2" is duplicate. So you set index 2 elements as index 3. And loop will take your index 3.
This way you left index 1 and 2 as duplicate elements.

‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪It seems ok, are you sure you are getting error on this line.‬

‪Anu (talkcontribs)‬
‪yes, it is showing the error for this particular line. I tried executing the program on different IDE also, it is showing the same syntax error.‬

‪Have you define the list1? i.e. list1=[1,2,3]‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪If you have defined the list and still getting error. It will be helpful to share code so we can figure out the root of error.‬

‪Anu (talkcontribs)‬
‪Hello all, now I'm not getting the error. Sorry I am unable to share the code when it showed error as I did not save it. Now when I'm executing using the above for loop condition, its not showing any error. Thanks for help and support.‬

‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪Just share what ever code you have...Without code how we can understand that you are wrong.‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Amichoksi (talkcontribs)‬
‪That's great, you could do. if you cannot share the code publicly, i guess private talks too are available to a particular user only.‬

‪Numpy doesn't come bundled with official python distribution also it is not some built in module. It needs to be separately imported, but the online interpreter allow using only built in modules.‬

‪RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded in comparison‬
Why is it so ?
‪It's to avoid a stack overflow. The Python interpreter limits the depths of recursion to help you avoid infinite recursions, resulting in stack overflows. We can adjust the stack limit but it's just beyond the scope for now.‬
