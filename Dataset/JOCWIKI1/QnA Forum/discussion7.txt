‪I can see other mistakes too. But i never give full code to anyone even though i can. Bcz it will stop her leaning phase.‬
They will just copy paste the code. You learn more when you find-out solutions your own. Otherwise google is there..
.they can search every thing
‪Ex: Challenge question...I can see almost all ans were copied from google. ‬
Everyone is using functions which were not taught yet.

In printing pattern how to remove space at end before \n

‪In printing pattern how to remove space before \n‬

‪4 months ago‬


‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪Use logic :‬
There is hidden element in print command. Which we can use that to remove extra space after elements. 
its end=" "
default value : end = "\n"  \n new line
If you removed \n and place space(" ") it will add space after each print. 
Think little how you can use it to fulfill your requirement. 

‪Edited 4 months ago‬



‪Amichoksi (talkcontribs)‬
‪you have to write logic for the last line to be printed, and do not add space in it.‬

Indian National Olympiad in Informatics, 2007 I need some help in solve this problem
One comment • ‪4 months ago‬



‪Rohit09 (talkcontribs)‬
‪(Indian National Olympiad in Informatics, INOI, 2007) In the pre-smartphone era, most mobile phones with numeric keypads had a private dictionary of words to allow users to type messages quicker. On a typical phone of this type, each number key is assigned a subset of the alphabet {a,b,…,z}: 2 is assigned the subset {a,b,c}, 3 is assigned {d,e,f}, 4 is assigned {g,h,i}, 5 is assigned {j,k,l}, 6 is assigned {m,n,o}, 7 is assigned {p,q,r,s}, 8 is assigned {t,u,v} and 9 is assigned {w,x,y,z}. When the user types a sequence of numbers, this sequence is mapped to all possible words that can be constructed from the key assignment. For instance, if the user types 66, this could correspond to any one of the letter sequences "mm", "mn", "mo", "nm", "nn", "no", "om", "on" or "oo". These letter sequences are looked up in the dictionary stored in the phone and all matches are reported. For instance, if the phone's dictionary contains only "on" and "no" from this set of sequences, the user will be offered a choice of "on" or "no" to insert in the message. Similarly, the input 4663 might be interpreted as either "good" or "home". An input sequence may have a unique interpretation---for example, the only word in the dictionary matching the input 28 may be "at". Other sequences may not match any word in the dictionary—for instance, 99999. Your task is the following. Given the typical assignment from number keys to letters of the alphabet given above and given a dictionary of words, report the input sequence that matches the largest number of words in the dictionary. For example, if the dictionary consists of the words {at,on,good,no} then the answer is 66, because 66 matches both "on" and "no" while no other input matches more than one word in the dictionary. On the other hand, with the dictionary {at,on,good,no,home,gone}, the answer is 4663, because 4663 matches three words, "good", "home" and "gone" in the dictionary. Solution hint For each word in the input, compute the number key sequence that creates it by inverting the mapping 2→{a,b,c}, 3→{d,e,f} etc. Store the number corresponding to the word in an array. After reading all the input, sort the numbers in the array. Input format The first line of input is an integer M, the number of words in the dictionary. This is followed by M lines of input. Each line contain one word from the dictionary, where a word is sequence of characters from the lowercase alphabet {a,b,c,…,z}. Note: Each word in the dictionary is, in general, an arbitrary sequence of letters from {a,b,c,…,z}. In particular, it is not assumed that the words stored in the dictionary are valid words in English or any other language. Output format A single line containing the input sequence that matches the maximum number of words in the dictionary. If multiple input sequences qualify for the maximum number of matches, it suffices to report any one. Test data For all inputs, 1 ≤ M ≤ 100000. Each word in the dictionary is at most 8 characters long. In 50% of the inputs, 1 ≤ M ≤ 1000. Example Here is the sample input and output corresponding to the example discussed above. Sample input 1 4 at on good no Sample output 1 66 Sample input 2 6 at on good no home gone Sample output 2 4663‬
