Week 8Anagrams Part 3 lec 150

‪The code for this program is not working right e.g.if I enter 'abc' as 1st word and 'aad' (I'm not considering any meaningful word), then the ASCII values for both the words is 294 and hence it is showing that they are anagrams, but actually they aren't. BUT YES OFCOURSE, THE SECOND ONE CODE OF 151 LEC WORKS. But how can I solve it using ASCII values in code?‬

‪Edited 3 months ago‬



‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪ASCII values are not totally reliable for finding anagrams....‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Nilu5698 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Yes. That was my main concern about it.... but if ASCII values are to be used, some modifications are needed, but that is not keeping the code short and simple.‬

‪Edited 3 months ago‬



‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪As i mentioned earlier ASCII values are not totally reliable for finding anagrams. So there is point of using it. But if you still plan to pursue with it. You may encounter failure. Which is hard to tackle.‬

‪Amichoksi (talkcontribs)‬
‪opencv-python module is to be installed on your system.‬
‪on ubuntu:‬
‪sudo pip3 install opencv-python‬
‪on windows:‬
‪python -m pip install opencv-python‬

‪u can look in lecture notes of week8 at http://sccilabs.org/jocwiki/index.php/Lecture_Notes:_Week_8‬

‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪Then you dont have cv2 library. You have to install it. with command: pip install opencv_python in anaconda command prompt(not in window command prompt)‬

‪In tests, they will check whether you have used ceil or not, so it should be used.‬

assignment 1

‪Seenusrini (talkcontribs)‬
‪I am getting 75% in assignment 1. I don't know what I have to add in my code. I am incrementing day by 1 when the man buy food. So the day never be in float value in my code. So there is no need of ceil function here. What I want to ask is, is there any another method to calculate day value which have float value? so that I can convert it into int value using ceil function. please reply asap. Private test cases are killing me!‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪Remember you dont have to increment(in buy food) on Sunday. Player have to survive what ever left over from past days on sunday.‬
If left over is not sufficient(means less then "m") player will die.

There is no use of celi. You can use int and add one(as celi gives higher integer then x). I got 100/100 without using celi.

‪I have written the program for assignment 1 and it is passing all cases and giving correct output in all cases without presentation error when I am clicking on compile & run it is passing all the cases without presentation error but after clicking on submit button it is showing "2 out of 4 tests passed. You scored 50.0/100" what is the problem here, do I need to post my code also?‬

‪I am also facing the same problem...if possible pls once share ur code...becoz today is the last day..thanks in advance‬

‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪This is because you missed some hidden cases. You need to rethink on possible cases and designed your code accordingly.‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪They provide 4 test case to check any problem in your code. But there are some hidden test to check extend-ability of your code. Which you cant see, your code is must be failing in those test case. Thats why you got 50/100 upon submission. So you have to correct your code until you get 100/100 after submission.‬

‪Amichoksi (talkcontribs)‬
‪many people are asking and me too having question about N<M answer should be NO, fine, but a test case SNM=12 9 8 answer should not be NO. Sachinbhai, please verify. and tell‬

‪4 months ago‬



‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪N : Food can purchased per day‬
M : Food consumed per day to survive
If N < M  :::  He is consuming more then purchase >> So Answer will be "NO"
But in Test case you mentioned SNM = 12 9 8  
He is purchasing more then required to survive for a day. So he will survive.
Explanation: 
As diff is 9-8 = 1
he is saving 1 unit per day. And till 11th day he will save 10*1 = 11 unit
which is enough to survive on 12th day.......So he will survive and answer will be 11


Coding is simple for this assignment once you understand concept. It took hardly 10min after understanding concept. 

Hope you understand and will finish the assignment soon.
I left a Hint in explanation which will help you in coding.....

Good Luck

missed a point so rectify in below post..

‪3 months ago‬


‪Afzalsayyed99 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Sachin bro, when nou = 2-2 = 0 that day is Wednesday and he ate 2 units and survived Wednesday and bought 3 units next day and on Saturday same situation occurred and he died on Sunday. In this case, the answer will be "NO", I still didn't get what's wrong.‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪ok its wednesday..‬
1Day you bought 3 and eat 2 left/surplus =1
2Day you bought 3 and eat 2 left = 2
3day you bought 3 and eat 2 left = 3

on 3rd day your nou variable must have value 5 and after consumption(2). Surplus must must be 3. But your code produced 0.

There are multiple mistakes in your coding. Below i point out few rest you have to figure-out:
1. Shop is closed on Sunday not saturday.
2. C variable can have flot values as you didnt rectify it.
3 end =  must have " " in print command to remove /n

please re- design you code. As i  said ealier. Use pen and pencil and evaluate you code step by step.

‪Edited 3 months ago‬



‪Rmanish (talkcontribs)‬
‪At end between inverted commas space is used when you required space if you dont give space it simply remove the /n and if you give space it remove the /n and put there a space‬
‪At c I have used // which gives me int value‬
‪I am checking c or h or g= saturday means he have food at saturday but he can't buy food next day. Means he died‬

‪3 months ago‬


‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪As i run your program. First error it show in  print("NO",end=) >>> Invalid Syntax‬
as you are using end= but not assigning any value to it

Dont mind-- You program is little confusing for me.

Next time use variable with name(like= left_food, total_food) instead of a,b,c,d,e 

Example:  input = 12 2 2
As 2 is purchased and 2 is consumption. Player should survive. But your below code is killing the player.

if((h%7==0) or g==6):           # checking the day saturday or not
     print("NO",end="")
     break

‪Edited 3 months ago‬


‪Rmanish (talkcontribs)‬
‪One thing I am not understanding here he can buy 2 food and he have to eat 2 for survive. Suppose it is saturday he bought 2 packet and he ate them. At next day he can't buy food means at sunday then he should die. Because he has not any extra food for next day.‬

Hints for Assignment One:
One comment • ‪3 months ago‬



‪Sachinkr (talkcontribs)‬
‪Hints:‬
1. If n = m and s<8:   >>> Player will die definitely
2. (n-m)*6 < m         >>> Player will die definitely. As player required food must be equal or grater than m on 7th day
3. else == you can count number of day with simple code. 

If there is any die condition. Think on that and add to your code.

Hope i helped..

‪pip3 is used on Ubuntu OS if i am not wrong. If you are using windows. Use "pip" instead "pip3" as Sam mentioned above.‬

Programming Assignment 1: Survive -
7 comments • ‪4 months ago‬



‪Lakkaraju n (talkcontribs)‬
‪Hello, I have doubt regarding "Programming Assignment 1 (i.e. Survive) in Test Case 2 Input:(s, n, m) = (12 9 8) Output: NO" According to my understanding, if n < m, output should be "NO". But, in this case, n > m. i.e. poor person can buy food (8) which is less the day max limit (i.e. 9 ). Can you please check the question and confirm whether my understanding is correct or not? Thanks, Raju.‬

‪True. But this is one of the conditions. Try enumerating all the possibilities. What if you buy every day with the given constraint. Can you survive? Please check once :-) NOTE: What will happen on Sunday?‬

‪<pre> S – Number of days you are required to survive. N – Maximum unit of food you can buy each day. M – Unit of food required each day to survive. It is a Monday. Step 1: You buy N items and eat M items. There are two possibilities. a. (N > M) You may buy excess of what you really eat. So, the remaining items are accumulated. b. (N < M) ie. You buy less quantity, so you can not survive. Step 2 : Since Sunday is a holiday, you can not buy food. So the remaining items must be sufficient on Sunday. If not, you can not survive. Step 3: Calculate how many items are required to survive for S no. of days. Find out how many times you need to buy items. Hint : you may gave to use a function to find the ceiling of a value. </pre>‬

Week 8: Anagrams , Void in 1st logic

‪Yashipro13 (talkcontribs)‬
‪In the first logic of anagram,if we sum up the ascii value of both the strings, the code may give incorrect output in any case like following scenario string 1 : ad string 2 : bc The code will say anagrams because ascii value sum is same.‬
