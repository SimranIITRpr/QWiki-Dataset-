‪For the code below, answer i get is 0 always even by changing the count limit more or less than 100000: import scipy.misc import random‬
‪img=scipy.misc.imread("map-01.png")#2481x2736‬
	1	‪dots present in punjab region and other region‬
‪countPunjab=0 countIndia=0 count=0 while(count<=100000):‬
‪   #in Python, x and y are reversed in case of images‬
   x=random.randint(0,2735)
   y=random.randint(0,2480)
   z=0
   #RGB values of black and grey region
   if(img[x][y][z]==60):
       countIndia +=1
   else:
       if(img[x][y][z]==80):
           countPunjab+=1

‪while(count<=100000): x=random.randint(0,2480) y=random.randint(0,2735) z=0 r,g,b=rgb_im.getpixel((x,y)) if(r==60): count_i=count_i+1 count=count+1 else: if(r==80): count_p=count_p+1 count=count+1‬

‪Code is working properly. Sorry, but i myself have to format it. You could use, pre tag. It's ok.‬
‪import numpy as np‬
from PIL import Image
import random


im=Image.open('Map-01.png')
rgb_im=im.convert("RGB")
count_i=0
count_p=0
count=0

while(count<=100000):
    x=random.randint(0,2480)
    y=random.randint(0,2735)
    z=0
    r,g,b=rgb_im.getpixel((x,y))
    if(r==60):
        count_i=count_i+1
        count=count+1
    else:
        if(r==80):
            count_p=count_p+1
            count=count+1

area_p=(count_p/count_i)*3287263
print(area_p)

#Output: 49923.81552205472

Assignment 9 : Question 4
13 comments • ‪3 months ago‬



‪Indrag79 (talkcontribs)‬
‪The answer to Question 4 of Assignment 9 should be the 4th option, i.e., None of the above, as the other closest 1st option, i.e., i=scipy.misc.read(“Image_name.png”) is incorrect. Actually instead of i=scipy.misc.read(“Image_name.png”) it should have been i=scipy.misc.imread(“Image_name.png”) which includes the 'imread' part. Do you all agree with this?‬

‪Shubham714 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Yes i also agree with you‬

‪Indrag79 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Moreover by using i=scipy.misc.read(“Image_name.png”) it would throw an error as it was also shown in the programming screen cast. Whereas, by using i=scipy.misc.read(“Image_name.png”) instead the issue was even resolved.‬

‪Indrag79 (talkcontribs)‬
‪I mean by using i=scipy.misc.imread(“Image_name.png”) instead the issue was actually resolved. Sorry for the typo 'read' instead of 'imread' part‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Saikat26 (talkcontribs)‬
‪Yes, totally agree with you @Indrag79. Answer to the question no. 4 should be 4th option (None of the above). Why is it showing 1st option is correct? The correct answer should be i=scipy.misc.imread(“Image_name.png”) and 1st option was given as i=scipy.misc.read(“Image_name.png”).‬
‪Please do respond. Thank you.‬

‪The web page's codes are so weak, in fact sometimes answers are already highlighted in white shade. I also inform you that in week_9>Area Calculation - Don't Measure - Part 05>(12:24), in this point, it was repeatedly told about a mistake. But when I'm following that, my answer was wrong. (WHY???) I hope you recheck that question ASAP. (IF POSSIBLE PLEASE REPLY)‬

‪How can we read an image in the form a matrix in Python?‬
‪Answer shows:-‬
‪i=scipy.misc.read(“Image_name.png”)‬

‪but in real it should i=scipy.misc.imread(“Image_name.png”)‬
‪so i choose "none" option‬

‪(now it get check)‬

area calaulation & assignment problem-01 issue
6 comments • ‪3 months ago‬



‪Raushan1047 (talkcontribs)‬
‪area of punjab should be calculated by this formulla ----->>>>>‬
‪area_of_pun=(count_pun/(count_ind+count_pun))*3287263‬
‪since,,,,‬
‪         area of pujab=(no. of dots in punjab / no. of dots in india(included punjab))*area of india(included punjab)‬
but in program they have caluculated area liks
‪area_of_pun=(count_pun/count_ind)*3287263‬

‪Saikat26 (talkcontribs)‬
‪I agree with @Raushan1047. I think the approach taught by faculty is not 100% correct. Corrre4me if I am wrong. Why the number of dots in punjab will be excluded in the denominator? We learned the same way as Raushan discussed above in ratio and mixture topic of Mathematics. Do you all agree?‬

‪3 months ago‬



‪Simmi (talkcontribs)‬
‪See this is an approximate calculation of the area and not the exact one. In denominator you should take no of dots excluding the concerned state.‬

‪please check whether your system has two python versions and same way two networkx. in many systems, python is installed by default, and it is of lower version. when you install any python ide with that too, new version of python is installed. when you install networkx on terminal it goes to old python installation and not to the new version. please check.‬

‪"for author, files in papers.items(): federalistByAuthor[author]=readFiles(files) " here, there are two variables 'author' and 'files' in the for loop, How is it working? Can anyone please explain to me with general context(not the current situation)?‬

‪It is a dictionary. It works with key and value pairs. papers.items() returns author, files, so it works fine.‬
