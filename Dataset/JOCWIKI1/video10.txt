I frankly remember playing a game during my school days. So what we will do is, we would write down two names and try to cancel out common letters and then try to find out the remaining letters and then count them. Once you have a count, once you note this down what we would do is, we would write down this word flames f l a m e s and we would go ahead and we would try cancelling out the letters after counting the given number and whatever remains is the relationship between these two people. For example let us take names of two people amit and amit likes deepika the celebrity right? so what we can do is we can try to see what, what will their relationship lead to right this is a very childhood game that we all have played at least I had played my classmates would be a whole lot of this so a and a gets cancel the amit ‘a’ and deepika ‘a’ and ‘m’ is not in common! ‘I’ and ‘i’ gets cancelled, ‘t’ is not in common so the number here would be m t d e e p k which is one two three four five six and seven, now what we do, we start counting from ‘f’, ‘f’ is one ‘l’ is two, ‘a’ is three, ‘m’ is four, ‘e’ is five and ‘s’ is six so one two three four five six and seven moment seven comes that part is struck out and again I will start with ‘l’ one two three four five six seven and ‘a’ gets struck out, one two three four five six seven ‘s’ goes away, one two three four five six seven ‘l’ goes away ‘m’ is one ‘e’ is two ‘m’ is three ‘e’ is four, five six seven ‘m’ goes away and ‘e’ remains so the fun conclusion would amit and deepika have the relationship enemies, ‘e ‘for enemies so similarly ‘f’ stands for friend, ‘l’ stands for love, ‘a’ stands for affection, ‘m’ stands for marriage that amit will be marrying the celebrity deepika and e means they are enemies which unfortunately turns out to be the answer, ‘s’ is the celebrity is a sister so as I said it is a fun game people would have played this but the reason why we choose this as a example is this represent a very famous mathematics question called the Josephus problem ok if you are interested you can take a look at it but what interest us in joy of computing is to write a piece of code for this and what would we do, a piece of code that will ask for the guys name and then the celebrity girls name and then will tell you what is the relationship between them using this fun algorithm

Hello guys, welcome to programming screen cast on flames. So flames is nothing but a game that is a very interesting game that most of you would have played in your childhood I guess or if not played you would have seen someone playing or you would have seen some where the game is being played some experience would be there. So we are going to relive those childhood days through this joy. So before starting with the programming part let me take you back to that memorable days by explaining what this actually game is, what this game flames is, so we will start off with it. So in flames what are these things f l a m e s it’s not just a single word, all these have some expansion sort of thing so f stands for friends, l stands for love, a stand for affection. M stands for marriage, e stands for enemy, s stands for siblings so this is what we abbreviate and call as flames so basically in this game if you could see, see some two names are given and mostly it would be the case that one is a boy and one is a girl it you can that makes sense basically for flames if you see the expansion will have something like love, marriage all those are generally between people of different genders right. so it’s generally case that one of your name is of a male and other one is of female so two names are given and you are suppose to predict a sort of just say what could be the relationship that could exist between these two people. For example ajay and priya are the two names we have, what is the relationship between these two? This what you are going to predict. So what we generally do is, we would strike out the common letters between the two names and then will start counting from here, how many letters are left out based on that will start counting and will cross out each and every letter and slowly will proceed till we just have one letter left out in this word flames and that particular letter is the result is what is displayed. This is how it goes maybe let me go slowly. The first thing is I said you should cross out the common letter right? you should cross out the common letters so as you could see there are two names you need to cross out the common letters, we will explore this part of crossing out the common letters see you take a single name ajay, you have two letters here and here that is common that is here is also a letter ‘a’ here is also a letter ‘a’, you cannot cross out these two this crossing out is not allowed, what is allowed is you have a ‘a’ here and you have a ‘a’ in the other person’s name so you can cross out these two letters and this is allowed, so once you have crossed out the names now that remain is j and p r I y, that is the names that remain. So as I said you can remove ‘a’ or you cross out ‘a’ and what you have as remaining you compare those two names see as I had said you are comparing these two names and here also you have a letter in common ‘y’ so you have to cross out this letter ‘y’ I am sorry this has to be ‘y’ so remove ‘y’ and now compare these left out strings J A and P R I you have to compare it. J A and P R I if you compare there is no match there is nothing common between these two strings so in this point of time you count how many letters are remaining, one two three four five, five letters are remaining so here the answer we get is five. Now you have the word flames, you start counting from the left count five because we got five in the previous so count five, one two three four five see so E is where we are stopping at so you have to cross out that E so E enemy is not the relationship you have to cross it out and the next round you should not take it as F L A M S instead you should start from this point S start at S and then you add of the left hand side part, whatever is in the right side you have to take it first then you have to add the left side as it is, that is how you have to take it for the next round so
 
the next round now I get as F L A M now I have to repeat it with this let me do that ok as F L A M one two three four five I am at M so M is crossed out so after you cross out M whatever is in the right there is nothing in the right so leave it then whatever is in the left S F L A this is in the left so you have to check it with S F L A now see we have four letters remaining but we need to go in counts of five so where will we go for the fifth letter, noting lust come back to the first letter and start counting again this is how you do, this is what we call as modular counting that is what we are going to do now go in the clockwise direction sorry anti clockwise direction sorry anticlockwise ok so S F L A so you have to start counting five letters from the left and go back in the anticlockwise direction I am sorry this is anticlockwise S F LAone two three four again come back here five so you are at S so you cross out S so whatever is in the right F L A whatever is in the left nothing so now you have to compare F L A let us do that F L A same like that you have to count five and you have to go out in the anticlockwise direction please note this its anticlockwise because we are going this way we are going in this way so it is anticlockwise so one two three four five we are at L so L is not the relationship so you cross this out you cross out this L, L is not the relationship you cross it out now what is remaining? In the right side you have A you write it then on the left side you have F write it, so you are left out with Aand F now we have to repeat it with this so let us do that A and F will count five steps one two three four five so at A we are standing so we have to cross out A and now we are left with just one letter F and this is when we have to declare the result is friends so ajay and priya were friends is what we got. This is how we have to play this game. So what is the thing that is slightly challenging here is you have to do the modular counting and you have to start counting from the part where you left that is that time we had stopped at E so we have to start our string next time with S so S F L A M we have to take, we could not take F LAM S so that is where is the tricky part here so we have to try coding this thing that is what we are going to do in this exercise. We will see that in the next video.

Alright guys, so in the previous video you had seen what is this game of flames. So it is basically you have two names and you have to cross out the common letters across the two names that is within the name if there is letter repeats you cannot cross it out, if it repeats that is if you have one letter at name one and other letter at name two you can cross out the two letters like that you keep crossing the common letters and at the end how many letters are left out you have a count of it and you go in steps of that many number of counts along the word flames from the left and if it exceeds the word length you again come back to the first letter in the anticlockwise direction and you proceed it, this is how you play flames right so we had run through an example we had taken two names ajay and priya and we had run through and we found that at the end of our game the letter that remains is F which denotes friends so ajay and priya are friends is what we got as a result. So something like that we have to play the game so for that will do the programming part now, before going into the actual programming part I would like to give you some introduction to some pre requisites that is needed to code this joy flames so let us go ahead with the pre requisites. So the string is nothing but the list of characters as you could see string is what the technical term we give for words, name is nothing but words right so name consists of group of characters so like that we have a group of characters, group of letters, letters is technically called as characters and a group of characters is what we call as string technically so when dealing with strings we need to know of some functionality of strings and which is available in the python package namely string there is a package name string so let me import that first import so let me say let me start so the first thing we have to do is import this package named string let me do that import string this is the name of the package, yes we have imported this package string, if you feel the name is lengthier you can use as and give us smaller name s g something like that, that’s your wish from this string ok I am doing this, so let me say those string I have s is some string strings the notation is we initialising with double quotes so let us say the name of the person is raj, raj is the name of the person so if this is a name of the person I have a mix of capital letter that is the upper case character we call them as the capital letters and the small letters we call them as lower case characters we have a mix of upper case and lower case. If I want to convert it to all in upper case or in all in lower case I have a functionality with a corresponding name let us see that, so first let me see for lower case that is all small letters is what we call as lower case, lower case is nothing but small letters, I want to convert into completely small letters so I would do it as print I want to print it in that format I will print it I will print it see s dot lower is the functionality we have this functionality s dot lower, if I print see I am getting the name in all small letters same if I want it for all caps what I will do is print s dot as you would have guessed its upper cast the capital letters are technically called as upper case characters so we will use the functionality upper, upper ok this is the functionality so let me press enter see RAJ its printed in all caps the upper case letters so this is how you get the complete lower case or complete upper case of a mixed string or even if you give in all small letters if you still apply s dot lower there is no problem it will return the same string there is what this functionality does is it will check if the given input string has all small letters if yes it will return the same string otherwise it will convert all letters to smaller letters and return that converted string similar is that for upper function, it will check
 
if all the input characters that is the input string has some characters if all those characters are in upper case that is the capital letters or not if everything is in capital letters already it will return the same input otherwise it will convert the letters into the corresponding capital letters that is the upper case letters and return the converted string so this is how these two functionalities work. So upper and lower these functionalities for it to work properly to import this package string and the next thing is we were actually looking at individual character level right so we were checking this particular letter ajay A the first letter whether is it present in the next name priya it was present so we cancelled the next letter j we will compare, it was not present next letter A we will compare it is not present, so something like that we will be doing, right so we will compare letters by letters so when we have this has a whole string we cannot do that comparison so we need to convert it into list of characters list of individual letters that is what we need to do it, that will be required in our program so we will see how can this be done so let me say string list is nothing but list of the string s the variable is s so I am passing it ok so it was converted into a list so let me see what is present so let me say print string list ok so it contains the individual letters R A and J so it is the a single string is converted into list of three characters right so this list function precisely does that it will take the individual character make it an element and convert it convert a single string into list of individual characters that is what this functionality does. Another thing you can do with this strings is you can find and replace I hope you would have heard about this terminology this is most popular if you are a movie watcher as well if you watch in movies some movies have comedy scene based on that I hope you remembering three idiots is one of them it has been remade in into some other languages as well so in that they will find a particular word and replace it with some other word and they will make the hilarious situation out of it something like that we can do replace operation here so we will find a character and replace it with something else so let us say I don’t want to print J I want to print some other letter in place of it so how should I do that, so I would say print I want to print the result S dot replace is the name of the functionality replace of as I said I don’t want J so I will write J here J with let me say I want to print it with hash so I will say hash so if I say it is printed as R A hash in place of J hash is substituted so this is replace function precisely does that it will search for this particular string here and it will substitute this string in place of it, this is a source string this is a target, this is the source this is the target it will search for the source and it will replace it with the target its not necessary that you need to give single letter you can give sub strings as well so let me say let me modify it I will say AJ I can give a substring a part of the string is called what you call as substring in substring what is mandatory is the letters must be in same order if I say AJ and if I say if I press enter see R and the part AJ gets converted into this hash and here this is case sensitive that means if it is in a small letter this has to be in a small letter otherwise it won’t agree if you say if I say RA and say enter see hash J is the output so this particular substring RA is searched and in place of that you are substituting hash it happens now I will check with smaller ra small ra I will check see you are not getting something like this you are getting raj completely because it is case sensitive that is whatever is the it is a smaller letter or a capital letter that it is upper case or lower case letter depends on that it will find and substitute so this replace functionality is case sensitive we call it as case sensitive by case sensitive we mean if it is a capital letter you must say capital letter if it is small letter you must say small letter it won’t match ok it’s the same letter

just that, that is in caps and this is in small it doesn’t perform that kind of a match that is what we call as case sensitive and most of the passwords are case sensitive if you have been using it in your mail or with your net banking anywhere the passwords are case sensitive so in that case if you a capital A it is different from a small a this is what we call as case sensitive, alright this is how this replace functionality works and even you can give something so let me say I will I will give this capital RA and I can give star hash I can give something like that as well so even here you can give a substring in place of this substring you substitute this substring that can also be given it is telling us star hash and J or maybe I can do this way as well I can say just A see what happens let us see in case of A star hash has been substituted so this is nothing but you find this source whatever is the source in place of that substring you substitute this substring that is what this replace functionality does, I hope you are clear with this why would you use replace functionality in the code will see. alright the next thing that is needed is slicing of a list, I hope you have used it already in a some of your previous weeks but still let us have a recap because we will be using tI extensively here the slicing place a major part here so we will see a recap of it so let us see we had a list right sl this is a list you had R A J in case I want to extract only the specific part of the list, this is hte smaller list so let me take the larger list let me say L equal to I will take letter because we are going to deal with strings so will take letters only a b c d e this has to be a comma f ok so let us consider this list containing six elements this is my list L containing six elements a b c d e f so if I want to extract some portion of this list only and display that is what we call as slice in your taking the slice out of the entire list is what you call as slicing so how would you do that L within the indices brackets square brackets you should give the start index from the let me say index one up till index four let me say let me see what happens ok as you could see I had given index one to index four so what is the output, it starts from index one as you know the list indexing starts from zero so A is at index zero, B is at index one, C is at index two and so on so index one the letter found is B so B is printed index two C is printed index three D is printed index four E is not printed so this is how the slicing functionality works, the end index is ignored so this means when you reach the index four you stop the process you don’t print that you don’t included that is what this means so this portion of the list is sliced and taken so this is how slicing works and another thing is this is not mandatory to give both the indices the start index and the end index. That is it is optional so if I say list of I don’t give a start index I just give a end index let us see what happens ok this is the output see you are getting A B C D just before the fourth index so if you don’t give a start index the default value that is taken is zero, zero is taken as the default value and from zero till four minus one three the third index everything gets printed everything gets added to the output, aright what if I don’t give the end index? I will say two I don’t give an end index what happens from index two see A is at index zero, B is at index one, C is at index two from index two it prints the entire list so the default value of the end index if you don’t give is taken as the length of the list so a recap or summary of what we have seen till now. Slicing is nothing but you cut the required portion of the list you just take the part of the complete list is what you call as the slicing you are taking a slicing of a list that is why you call it as slicing, give the square brackets and within that you need to give start index colon end index plus one please note that it is end index plus one because the last index won’t be counted into the output it will ignore at the index it will stop at that index so you have to give end index plus one and it is

not mandatory you to give both start index and end index it is optional in case you don’t give the start index the default value is taken as zero if you don’t give the end index the default value is taken as the length of the list so what if I don’t give both let me do that what if I do this? The entire list gets printed because the default values are taken so this works basically like L of zero to length of the list is six here so zero to six it will start at index zero print A, print B, print C, print D, print E, print F which is at index five and index six when the counter reaches six it will stop so it will stop here and it will print the entire list so this is how it will works if you give the value it will take that particular index the way you have to give is start index and end index and plus one please note this plus one fact end index plus one and if you don’t give the index it will take the default values, the default value for start index is zero the default value for end index is length of the list, ok guys I guessed you have a good revision of the list slicing which you had studied some weeks back as well as you saw the new functionalities of upper, lower, replace in strings please do explore these functionalities also there are some more functionalities that are available please do explore them and get more familiarised with these features with this command also yes one more command that you will be using in this we will see of this is the list L and I want to get the index of an element I know the element I want to get the index that can be done by using the function index let us see that. Print L dot index is the function you need to pass the element here the element let me say is D, I want to know the index of the element D so if I print I am getting three, the index of the element is three. In case if there are multiple places this element D is present if your list is A B C D, A B C D, A B C D E F just assume if that is your list then the first occurrence of the value that is what is returned as the output here the index function return the first occurrence of this element in the given list, the index function returns the first occurrence of the given element in the given list right because how this functionality works so what all you have seen, we have seen the upper functionality which converts the strings into completely upper case letters, lower functionality which converts the strings into completely lower case letters replace functionality searches for a sub string and substitutes with another sub string then we have seen list slicing with start index and end index plus one then if you don’t give the start index or end index what is the default values, how it works we have seen and we have seen the functionality of index which returns you the first occurrence of a given element in the list so this is what we have seen now this are the pre requisites that are needed to code flames so with this maybe you can start thinking and you can start trying the code flames so from this develop a logic and you check it with what we are telling in the next video that would be the best thing that’s the best way you can develop programming logic and you can develop by yourself I would recommend that and please do explore what are the other features available here and by this is by exploring and practicing, you become a better programmer and so keep practising is what I would say ok guys, thanks for watching this. Will see how to implement flames in the next video.

Alright guys, in the previous videos you had seen what is this game of flames, how is it played? We had taken some example and then we had traced through every step of the game how is it played then in the next video we had seen some pre requisites that is needed to quote flames one was using the functionality of string like replace, upper, lower etc and the other one was you have to know how to slice some part of the list so we are going to deal with list so we are going to convert a string into list of characters and that is how we are going to process it. So you have been given some insides on how you slice a list and how you deal with parts of list and all that’s what was given to you and index functionality was given to you that will be of great use for us, so let us now go ahead with the programming part so for that before starting of that I have recommended you that you analyse the game you understand the previous two videos understand the procedure of the game and then you use the pre requisites that has thought to you in the second video and based on these two you try coding flames and then in case you have done something you can verify what you have done with what we are telling and in case if it differs what I am going to say now is not the only way which you can do you can do with multiple ways so that may be some differences with which what you have tried and what I have been showing there maybe some differences so in that case please do discuss your strategy in the discussion form, so will be very happy to help you out on your approach and how it will work will it work in all cases that’s will help you out so you please go ahead and try it yourself then you come back and check here so just use this video as the verification for what you had tried. So don’t completely, blindly follow this video and code line by line you try yourself and come back and use it as a guide. This video is a just a guidance for you and how you can code flames, this is just one way by which you can do, there are many ways this is not the only way there can be multiple ways so you try out the different ways and please do discuss on the discussion form. Ok so let’s starts off with this as I have said first thing is we need to let me say I had imported string and now I have to input the name of the two persons so let me say person one p one I will get the name so to get the input I have to use the functionality input function input input and I have to give the message here I will say enter first person name let me call it as first person name I will get the input alright there may be a case that the person may use combination of capital letters and small letters as I have said the replace functionality and all the functionality so strings are case sensitive that is if you give capital letter it will strictly look for capital letter, it won’t consider the corresponding small letter version so it is case sensitive so it is better that we convert this input into a common format by using either of the upper or lower functions so I had demonstrated both of the things in the previous videos you can use whatever you wish so this is to ensure that the comparison are not skipped for example we had taken the names ajay and priya assume that they are using capital letters for the first letter of their name and rest they are using in small letters so if he will give an input as capital A j small j small y and the second input will be capital P small r small I small y small a so when you compare it will say capital A which is the first letter of ajay and small letter which is the last letter of priya it will say they are different but where as we want them to be considered as same so it is better that we convert them into a common format so that is why we are going to convert it into lower case let us say lower case so I will convert it into lower case so my new input will be my new
 
the name of the person my new name will be p one dot lower that is a functionality I am going to convert it into lower case so I had said this is just to ensure that the input is in the uniform format so this is how you converted into lower case and full name I had just taken the first names in the example that I have considered in case you are typing in your full names there may be the case that you may give your first name give a space then give a sir name for example ajay Sharma if that is the name ajay space Sharma they may input this space shouldn’t cause a problem anywhere so will trim out all the spaces from the name what if the first person has the lengthier name if it is ajay Sharma and the second person doesn’t have the sir name it just priya this space should not be counted as the extra character in the future runs and that shouldn’t cause the problems so will trim off all the spaces from the names so that will be what we will be doing here for that we will use the replace functionality that we had seen, so will do that the p one is now p one dot replace what do I want to replace the space with empty character nothing the space must be trimmed that’s what I want, so I am replacing it this is what I have done this is just to make sure that the space doesn’t cause problem in the final computation so we had done it for the person one the same goes for person two so let me copy and paste it and do some modifications its person two here its person two here even its person two its person two person two so what have we done till now? We have got the name, we have converted everything into lower case so that the miss matches due to one being in the upper case and one being in the lower case doesn’t occur we are converted everything into uniformly into lower case you can even do it for upper case and other thing what we have done it we have trimmed the spaces so whatever wherever we have the spaces we have cut off the spaces and we have made it into a just list of characters we just sequence of characters is what we have now. So we have the sequence of characters I have said so we have to convert it into list so let me say l one for list one let me say l one is nothing but I have to convert it into list so how will we do that using the list function list of the first person name p one so you have the list of characters similarly we wanted for l two the list of for p two the list of all the character in p two the person two name so now we have the list what should we do? We should remove the matching remove the matching letter from this list one and list two you have to remove this matching letter so this is what you want to do now so it’s not just one letter it is multiple letters so this has to run inside the loop just give a pause here and think how can you do it, this requires some amount of logical thinking to get it perfect so pause here for some time and think will see how this functionality can be implemented in the next video.
FLAMES 05
Alright guys, so in the previous videos you had seen how to play the game of flames we had raised it with an example then we say some pre requisites I had asked you to give a try to writing a code then this videos we have to take it as a guide lines just a guide lines that’s it this is not the only way by which you can do, you can do it in multiple ways so please discuss if you have another way in the discussion form and so in the previous I had started off by asking for input of two persons names, converting them into uniform format of all small letters I had trimmed off the spaces and now we have to see how to remove the matching letter that is the functionality we want to see. So let me say I will define this functionality here define remove matching letter right? That was the functionality right? so let me define it here so it had taken two parameters list one and list two it had taken two parameters so let me use it so what should I do? I have to take a letter of the first list take a letter check if the letter is present anywhere in the second list if so there is a match and you cross out otherwise you proceed with the next letter that’s what you are doing right? so for that what should we do we need to run loops so how many loops? Two loops, because we have to match for each letter at which position in the second list you have the occurrence of that letter so we need to have two loops so let us do that. So let me start my first loop for I in range so basically you are actually going through each and every index and checking the element right so I have to find the I have to check through till you reach the length of the string so range you have to give the end value plus one right basically so I want to go till the end of the string basically end of the string is nothing but length minus one that is the index of the nth so length minus one nothing but length we have to stop at this I guess you are familiar with this just that why we are giving it as length I was giving an explanation that’s it length of this list you have to pass that is for that many number of iterations that is for that many number of letters you want to make a check right? so iterate it over the first list same like that you iterate it over the second list for j in range length of the list l to k so what should you check? If the letters are matching so how would you check it? You have to use by indexing right so by name of the lists followed by square brackets within the square brackets you need to give the index so we will do the check now if the list one at the position I at the index I and the list two at index j contains the same letters that is check by equal to operator double equal to operator which checks the equality if they both are equal then you capture that letter that is your common letter you have to capture it common letter that is why I have used the letter c, c for common, common letter you can use l one of I or l two of j because both are equal right both the vales are equal so you can use anything here and now you have to remove the elements from the list so that’s what we will cross out in a paper we will cross out but in computer how do you cross out so crossing out is nothing but removing it from the list that is what we will be doing it. So let me remove l one dot remove is the functionality remove this element from the list and l two dot remove element same element c alright so now we will have to find once the letter is removed whatever is the string you need to have it and you need to do it for both the you have two strings modified right so let me concatenate it you will understand why soon let me concatenate the two strings two modified strings let me make a new list l by saying l one plus I am concatenating another list I will use a dummy character say star then I concatenate this list l two, why I am creating this concatenate list, you will come to know very soon this is
 
just one way this is not the only way you can do it in any way this is my way of doing that’s it. Its not the, the way of doing it just one way of doing it ok so this is my list and now here I have found a match at some letter so I had removed that letter and I have a new strings and in between the new strings I am using the star as the marker sort of a thing so this person first person name has ended and this is the name of the second person so I am using a marker right? so I will have to return that I will have to return that I have found a matching letter so remove matching letter is the functionality right so I have found the matching letter I have removed it so you have to say that you have to return that value to the call function so I will return a list say inside that list I will pass this concatenated list and I will say true I can pass any values right I can pass numbers, floating point values, characters, bullion values anything I can pass right so I will say I have proved that I have matching letter I have removed it and this is the list you get after removing the matching letter so you are concatenating it so you will run this loop for all the things right the very first time when you find a match you will remove the letter and return this that’s it in case you run through the loop completely and you still didn’t find the match what happens? It will come to the end of the loop right at this point so in that case you didn’t find the matching letter, in that case what should you do? You should return I will say same like that you generate this list this has to be done because this is done inside the loop right in case you came out of the loop this would never be executed and you need to do that so let me copy this line because I want to repeat it again so let me say I have created a concatenated list I will return the concatenated list and I will say false this is the concatenated list but in this two items I haven’t found the matching character that is why you are returning false so this is how you do so basically you run through the loop you check for each letter whether this letter is present in the next list anywhere if it is present you remove that matching letter and you return the concatenated list and return true, true stating that there was a matching letter and it was removed if there is no matching letter just you do the same concatenation process return the concatenated list and say false, false stating that there was no matching letters ok so this is how it has been run so we have been returning it so when we have returned it we have returned list right so we need to capture a list so let me say return list is nothing but we are capturing it and we need to do it continuously for some till three is no matching letter so how will I come to know that there is matching letter or there is no matching letter how will we come to know that? So we need to have a flag sort of thing this is what we call as flags n programming that will say whether to continue to proceed with something or you should stop sort of a flag, flag is an indicator for some directions sort of thing right so that indicates that something is present here flag indicate something like that here our flag will indicate whether there is some matching letters still present or should we still proceed or no that’s it so there is no matching letter you start counting with the flames part that is the second part of the game, first part is we have to cross out all the matching letters, second part is we have to go in the anticlockwise direction of counting to determine what is the relationship between two people in flames in the word flames right so we will be doing it so the first part is we are removing in the matching letter so the flag will say whether we can proceed towards second part or no we cannot proceed so let me use a flag for that let me say proceed, let me use the same name so that it is easier on mains proceed equal to true initially we have to proceed we have to the first run we must check for matching letters and then only we can we cannot directly start counting right we should check for matching letters

and then only we can start counting so the first run it is always true and as long as proceed is true you keep checking for the matching letters I will have to indent it now ok as long it is it says proceed you keep checking so the returned list contains two information one is the concatenated list and the other is whether you can proceed or not, that is one letter has been removed and you can proceed or there is no matching letters there is no need to proceed it returns whether we have to proceed further or not right? so it is returning two information so we have to extract that out from this returned list so concatenated list is what I want to make I want to extract out from the returned list so that is present as the first element of the list, the first element of our list is the concatenated list so I am removing it return list return list of zero, zero is the index by which you access the first element right remember that array the list indexing starts from zero the counting starts from zero please remember this ok so I have taken the concatenated list now the second part of the list is whether should I proceed or not? So it will say I have to proceed is nothing or not so proceed is nothing but is present in the concatenated list second position that is index one so I have taken the concatenated list and proceed and in this concatenated list concatenated list consist of the two names the concatenated and there is a star in between right see that’s how we have concatenated we have taken the name we had removed that common letter taken that name appended a star then we had taken the second name right that’s how we have it so the star marks is a marker that the first string has completed and after this whatever comes is the second string right so star is a marker so we have to find where is this particular index where this start is present so where is the star present we have to find and at that place we have to slice this list so this is where the list slicing what we had seen come into play so will be slicing the list here so let me say star index star index is nothing but concatenated list on this concatenated list what is the index of the element star that’s what I am going to check this is what I am going to call as star index and now I am going to extract out the lists again so l one is the name of the first person in the list format that is present before star right so you have to start from the first index and when you encounter the start you should stop you should not include the star you should include everything before star so what should be the end index? Whatever is the place where star is present right? Please give a minute time here think why am I doing this you will understand if you give some time that’s where the logical thinking I don’t want the star the functions behaves in such a way that whatever I give as an end index that will be ignored so as I had said I have to give a start index and end index plus one so if you just give end index it will just ignore the end index as well so I have to give plus one so I don’t want star I want star to be ignored that’s why I will give star index as my end index start index I don’t need to give I wanted from the beginning so the default value let it be taken and I will just give the end index so I will do it from concatenate the list we have to perform the slicing operation no need to give the start index because I want to start it from the beginning the default value and I have to ignore the value of the star this index where the star index this point the star is present I want to ignore that point so I will give that as my end index star index is where I want to end so whatever is there still you reach star index whatever is there that will be capture in this list l one ok same like that what should be there in l two, anything after star till the end so till the end I wanted so that’s the default value will be taken for end index so I need not give the value of end index but start index I should give, start index wherever I give its starts from there. So should I give star index as my start index? No because if I give star

index as my start index it will say star p r a I y I just want p r I y I just want the name I don’t want star here so I should say star index plus one the next place you should start my next slicing so I should say star index plus one is the starting index here star index plus one till the end, end value is taken as the default value is taken so till the end will be considered so two slices have been made. So this is why we had concatenated the list like this is the name we wanted and this is the name we wanted this is just one way or maybe you can pass it as list of three values as well you can think of it, you can pass it as l one comma l two comma true or l one comma l two comma false you can do it that way as well that is why even another way so as I have said there is no just single way by which you can do, you can do it by multiple ways so this is just one way of doing it, now just re through this loop so you had taken the list of characters, you had set some flag like proceed right, you had set it through true initially because you want to check if there is matching letters are not first instance you cannot take a risk of directly going to counting you should check for matching letters so I said proceed with the checking of matching so remove the matching letter so it will loop through the lists, it will loop through both the lists if it find a matching letter it will remove that from the list it will concatenate with the star in between, return the concatenated list and return true if it has found the matching letter and return false otherwise there is no if there is no matching letter it will return false so from this you will understand whether to proceed with next iteration that is we have found with the first iteration ajay and priya let us take the same example A and A it is return so should I continue with checking for another matching letter or can I continue with counting that is return by this proceed so that is extracted the concatenated list from that list we have extracted out and we have extracted the flag proceed so if it says true that is it has found one matching letter there is a possibility that there is another matching letter so we have to proceed it again if it was not represent if there was no matching letter present if you again check it again obviously you won’t get matching letter right? so that time you can stop so that is captured in this flag proceed and this is your concatenated list and star was the separating marker in our concatenated list so based on the star index I had sliced the list into two portions and I have my list l one and l two ready for my next iteration I have found my one matching letter and trying to find another matching letter if possible so I will repeat till all matching letters are found. If there is a position where there is no matching letter in that time I will say that ok this is when I have to stop there is no matching letter I have to stop so this is the part one of the game crossing out the matching letters next comes counting in a circular fashion and predicting the relationship in flames. We will see that in the next part of the video.

Alright guys, so in the previous part you had seen how we can remove the matching letters and check if we have to proceed with finding matching letters again or we can proceed with the counting of the letters. So we had run it using a loop so I hope you went through this thing you could understand this nippet please spend some time here its just a matter of time if you just spend some time you can easily understand what this is, what are the strategy we are using you can understand it, so ok by here we have we have taken two list we have obtained two list and there is no matching letters between these two lists so now what should we do? We should go with counting, how many letters are left out now? So now there is no matching letters, now we have reached at that position J A and P R I there is no more matching letters now we should start counting. So how will we do that? Will do that will take a variable say count just for counting we are counting how many letters are left out so let me say count it is nothing but length of the list l one and the length of the list l two right? Am I right? because J A is the list that is left out to you P R I is the list that is left out to you, the length of the first list is two, the length of the second list is three two plus three is five this is what you want to compute right? so that’s what you are doing, so we should declare the result now after going through the flames letters and we should declare the results so let me say that is result let me make use of a list result the first element is flames F, f for friends so let me say friends the next is love l for love f l a, a for affection m, m for marriage, e for enemy and s for siblings right? so this is my result array so among along this I have to if it is five I have to do it one two three four five I am at enemy so I should cut of it I should take the right part then I should take the left part concatenate it that will be my new result and there I have to proceed that’s how I have done right, so if you remember you would check through the very first screen cast video of this flames you would understand, you can check through it if you have confused here that’s how we generally do will stop at a place will cross out that word and then will take the right part then will take the left part that’s how will do that’s the trick here, had it been just remove I could have done something like that I would say I can start form friends that’s very easier but the trick here is you have to if you had stuck at enemy you have to start from siblings you cannot start from friends that’s where the knack here is so there you have to do it and so let me start coding so let me say where should I stop at this so I have to counting I have to keep counting this way one two three four five in that case what if some other names are given? Some ten letters are in common there are just sic flames f l a m e s there are just six items there are ten letters in common, what will you do? You will have to again start your counting of seven from here right from friends you will that is one two three four five six then seven will friends will again be counted as the seven l is eight, a is nine that’s how you will count it right, and ten is m that is your fourth element so ten mode six is your four that’s your fourth element you want that is as per the humans perception so modularity, modulo operator is that’s what we are using here that is we want to again come back to the starting point and count it this is what we call as modular counting, you keep counting if you reach the end you come back to the starting point and resume your counting that’s what you will be calling it as modular counting and in our computation it is the fourth element but as per the computer indexing it is one less right computer indexing starts from zero, we start counting from one so it’s one less so we have to take care of it so my resulting
 
index where should I make a split so I am standing at enemy I should make a split the right part and left part I should concatenate it right that’s what I have to do right so where should I make a split I should find that index let me call it as split index its easier if I give such a name so split index is nothing but I have to find the count modulo operator I have to use because if I exhaust the list I am coming back to the starting point and counting right so I have to use the modular operator this is called modular counting so I have to count it modulo length of the list my list is result I will find the length that is six count modulo six that is the human index and it differs from computer index by one so I have to subtract one so let me compute this first and from this value I have to subtract one. So by brackets I mean first compute this value count modulo length of the result and then from that resulting value subtract that’s why I am giving the bracket so then you put minus one ok this is my split index if my split index is what are the values it can take? It can take, can it take negative values? just think for some time, yes, it can take negative value because of there are six letters in common just count f l a m e s one, two, three, four, five, six at siblings you will be standing you cut off that part and to the right you have nothing so what will you say the count was six, six mode six it is zero minus one it will say minus one so it will say minus one which is out of the range of the list right so it can take negative values so if it takes positive values you have you process it in a different way that is if it is struck at middle point it will take a positive value, if it is struck at some of the ends it will take negative value so in that case that is if I am struck at siblings there is no right half right so I should concatenate just the left half so in that case I should process it differently if it is a positive and a negative value so first let us see how to process if it is a positive value then we will see for negative value, let us see if split index is a positive value by positive value what do I mean, it is greater than or equal to zero if that is a positive value what should I do, I have a right half and then I have a left half, right half is nothing but I should start at this, I have to slice the result, result list let’s say again here list slicing come into play so I have to slice the right half so this is my split index I have to start at the next point and go till the end so I should say split index split index plus one I have to start at this index and go till the end. Just think for sometime why I am giving this index, because we are on the right half and the next is left half, I want to consider everything except this except this split indexes so what should I give as a end index? Split index because the end index is by default ignore by the slicing functionality, I want to ignore this thing so I am giving that deliberately so I don’t need to give the start index because I want it from the beginning that’s the default value will be taken so I want to give the end index as this split index. So at this split index I want to take the left half because right half and left half is available so how should you get the new result? Right half followed by the left half right this will be your new result this is the case you have to do in case of this so the thing you have to do in case you, you are struck up at a point somewhere in the middle then you will get a positive value of split index and you can do this in case you are struck at this point you are getting the negative value of split index in that case what should you do? You should take the left half, so left half is nothing but that would appear only when you are struck at the last value, when you are stuck at the last value, your split index is the last value so in case if there are six common letters you will be stuck at siblings there is no right half that’s when you will get an negative index. So in that case what should you do you should just take the right half that is wherever you are stuck that split index must be ignored and the other things may be taken right, so

whatever is the length of the result that particular point that must be the last element must be ignored the other element must be taken whatever is your result the last element at that point must be ignored and other must be taken aright we will do that ok?. so how do we do it? The last element has to be ignored the others has to be taken so I will do the slicing appropriately I will say result is nothing but whatever is in the initial half I don’t care I just want to cut half the last element so the last element must be ignored if I just say length of the result what happens, the entire list would be taken but I don’t want the last element so I should ignore the length minus one that particular thing has to be taken care of, why do we give minus one? Because I want to ignore the last element so I will give length of my result minus one so the last element is ignored and you got the result right? so this is has to be repeated right? this will be the run for one iteration like that you have to repeat it till your result array is just result array is being sliced right so at every iteration one of the element f l a m e s one of them getting cut so the result array size reduces by one at every instance when the result array becomes of size one you have to stop and say whatever is left out is my result right? so you have to repeat this process so I will use a loop here I will do as long as the length of my result array is greater than one, as long as there are more than one elements you keep counting as long as there are more than one elements you keep counting and you split the array into left and right halves do accordingly you do that, if you get just exactly one element just stop at that position so now when this loop comes to an end what happens? There is just we have put it in a loop so that it gets repeated as long as there is just one element left out in the array and the loop comes to an end what happens? There is just one element present in the array that is your result. So what should I print? I should print, what is there in my result, result it is a list right so it will be printed with square brackets I want to print it without square brackets and there is just one element present that I know so how would I say, result of zero just the first element whatever is the element just print that answer that’s what we are doing here ok. ok I ma sorry here is an invalid syntax, I have to give the name of the array right result so I have done that ok so any other place ok yeah this is where I have taken and fine I guess everything is fine ok so now let me run it before that let me restore this view ok here is the console so here we have return the code maybe you can revise here you can take a pause here and revise what happens now will run it, let us run the code yes run alright now let us run the file, let me see it is asking for person one name let me say ajay, person two name it is let me say priya see it has returned friend as the result so like this you can input many names and yes you will it will compute the flames as per the game and you will get the result please do try this as well as if you have some other strategies of doing it please try that too and discuss with us on the discuss form, we will be very happy to help you with the different ways of solving the same thing, its actually interesting the game looks very simple but when you try coding there are different things to be considered like modular counting and you have to consider the right half then the left half, you cannot consider from the first and you cannot consider common letters along the same name it should consider it among the different name, it’s all like there are some intercases which we can we are doing it very easily by if we do it manually but when you are writing a code there comes a lot of logical thinking so you should practice more of such things and also please do discuss if you have played some other games n your childhood and you try coding it and discuss with us what are you have tried and what all you have played or if you want to try for something also please discuss in the discussion form will

try helping you out with whatever you want to code so literally you can code anything all that is need is some logical thinking that’s it. So you explore keep exploring a lot and this is how you can learn keep exploring, keep practicing, alright. Thanks for watching, have a nice day.
DATA COMPRESSION 01
So, imagine you try creating a website for yourself and in that website you have a lot of images and it takes forever to download this images when someone opens your website so what you do is option one you consider removing the images of course that’s not a good option given that you want to keep some images. A second option would be to reduce the size of these images by size I mean the bites that the picture takes. So how do you do that? Given an image how can one try reducing the size of the image, probably you will lose the image quality or you might you may not be able to do it for all you know right? Is there a way to do it? Is what we are gonna tell you, we will teach you a very naive very straight forward way of compressing an image. Of course there will be compromise in the quality but then what matters the most is the fascinating idea behind compression of image size by using the very straight forward naive technique.
 DATA COMPRESSION 02
HI guys, in this video we will see a basic illustration of numpy library of python so what numpy is? Numpy is actually is numerical python stands for numerical python so in our precious videos in our previous joys we have seen some part of numpy we have been using numpy a lot of times and to do some tasks to perform some tasks but in this video I will show you what else you can do, how basic operation you can perform in numpy very easily. So what exactly numpy is useful mainly it is useful to perform some matrix operations in python and to do it easily you are using use mostly numpy library so array what say matrix mostly matrix we use numpy and there are lot of lot of matrix if you know linear algebra and matrix and you must know that the application of matrixes are huge in mostly in image processing and even machine learning and ai matrix the applications are a lot mostly if you know matrices and their operations and you can definitely easily cope up with the ai elements and machine learning so even in deep learning so for that we use numpy library a lot suppose some of you wanted to want to machine learning or ai or deep learning whatever it is then you need to understand this library numpy library because you will be using this library a lot there. I will give you very very very basic operations in numpy library which you can perform. So let’s see this I will just import the library or let me just oh sorry yeah let me increase this pane in most of the videos I keep both of my pane because I like keeping this but you can when you are working on your programming part or coding part you can zoom out this part, zoom in this part or exclude this part vice versa so let’s see this let me import the numpy library so I will write here import numpy as my alias will be np here you can put here it’s the convention people mostly put np so you can put np here so you can put x also so looks nice here great. So I will create an array of how do I create array, I have been creating a array of elements before in python as a list for examples see this console here let me ok should be fifty fifty percent ok so let’s see this suppose I create a list of name l in my elements are one two three so I will make a list, list is created like this one comma two comma three ok and I will just run it and if I see the elements of this list I tell one two three so same thing I will do but it will create an array what’s the difference? What you can do? When you get an array as array just see it is an object when you get when you create an array of let’s say elements of one two three you can perform a lot of operations through numpy library which has been return this in this numpy library so you can perform all those operations a lot lot lot of operations there so will make an array of let’s say all these three elements one two three first so let’s see a is equal to np dot array it will show you here ok np dot array and what are my elements so let’s say one comma two comma three so the convention is you pass the list there, the list of array as an argument so np dot array will take an argument an argument will be my list great you just print this let’s see what happens, print a let me just run this we will see one two three exactly what I was expecting here I am getting here nothing different I got an array great now let me do some other thing here with this array I have the array just print something let me just write it and you will understand what is it exactly. Type of a ok see showing class numpy dot nd array n dimensional array this is one dimensional it is known as one dimensional array let me print something else one dimensional why because just one row and there are three columns if you see this as a matrix there is only one row this is one two three and there are three columns, first column second
 
column and third column so one row there are three elements so that’s why is the one dimensional array ok let me write some more functions let say a dot shape ok let me see this three comma nothing three comma nothing means it has one row and it has three columns, three columns one row great I can print the elements how am I supposed to get the elements same as the list a dot zero let say a one and a two it will give the elements as one two three so exactly same as the list how am I suppose to, how I receive the elements of a list using the indexes same analogy is there ok great I can change the elements also exactly if I want to change the elements of the index let say one and make it let say six and just run it and I can see the array one six three same analyst nothing, great what if I want to create a two dimensional array? Same thing let me just delete all these things I will change array as the two dimensional array so how I put two dimensional list? One list inside that there will be two lists. List number one will be first row ok so first row let’s say one comma two comma three ok comma second row is a list which is four comma five comma six that’s it let me run it to see yeah, it’s running everything is fine you can see a as if you run it array one two three four five six this is first row second row as an array and if you just print the shape of b not the shape of you shape of b shape b dot shape but you will see these sorry what did I put! It’s not b sorry sorry ok a dot shape to see two comma three ok so there are two rows two rows and three columns great awesome there are many ways through which you can create arrays and this is this is one way suppose I want to create suppose I want to create an array of all zeros one thing I will just put a list zero, zero, zero, zero, zero I can through loop I can create a list of zeros and I will pass the list that list or I will just directly use that whatever it is but through numpy you can with one line of code you can create such array easily. Suppose I want to create an array of zeros so I will just a is equal to nm dot said zeros and I will just give the dimension as array of matrix of two cross two zero ok I just run it I just see a see zero zero zero zero great or if I want to create an array of one’s np dot ones let me give the dimension as two comma two I will just run it I will see b give me one one one one great ok or if I want to put some particular number in all the at all the places let’s say so I can just put np dot full ok and let’s say I will give the dimension of array again two comma two and what is that constant let’s say I want to give six that’s it I will run it I will see c six six six six awesome great or if you want random numbers also that too is possible will just put np dot random dot random so you know random dot random put one zero two one you want from if you want from if you want integer then you can put integer values rand int so I will just give the dimension as two comma two and if you see d see some random values from zero two one between zero to one are coming in this array.
DATA COMPRESSION 03
So, we saw some basic functionality on num pad in this video we will see some more of these and after that we will start the next tutorial. So let’s see this let me import it again import the numpy library again so I will write import, import numpy as np so ok so let me create an array so np is equal to what was the command np dot array and then I will give the list which is let say one comma two. Now, I want to I want to know the data type of this data type of this list or this another numbers what is it? I will just print I will just print as x dot dtype that’s it if you run see int thirty two that is thirty two bit int ok suppose I change the array as let’s say this as one point o and this is two point o and now if you run this you see a float sixty four bit so this is a floating point value that’s why data type is showing is float sixty four great. Suppose you want to be force it to be something else you saw that it was showing int thirty two ok and if I want it to be it t be a sixty four suppose I want more values there which I know can be represented in sixty four bit only I need more numbers more numbers means more digits I mean more binary value I need so I can represent a big number. Suppose I want sixty four bit number to be represented so I need to force my data type to be a sixty four bit so what will I do I will create an array np dot array ok I will give the sorry I will give the list which I say one comma two and I will force it as dtype is equal to np dot int sixty four ok ok and now if I type print x dot dtype you see now it showing sixty four now it is allocated sixty four bit to represent these values, now you can if number which is as big as which can only be represented by sixty four bit binary numbers then you can represent it to before that you would have try to represented to would have been showing some overflow value or some other value. So you can force the number to represent in sixty four bit or even thirty two bit. Great now the best part of numpy is that why we use in post video that I told you that the main reason of using numpy is mostly to do some operations with array and matrix mostly matrix so matrix operations are very very easy in numpy and in most of the machine learning aI based technologies mostly it is matrix operations only. If you see an image it is basically nothing bunch of pixels represented in a matrix form so suppose you see a you see an image of let say five one two cross five one two and the height is five one two and the width is five one two if you read the image in a computer you see a matrix of actually you see a matrix three dimension matrix actually n cross p whatever so three dimensional matrix will be there and each with the size of one two cross five one two why three dimensional matrix because it contains rgb values red green and blue. And each cell of the matrix will contain a value which is between zero to two fifty five representing what range of red it is, what range of blue it is and what range of green it is then mixing all this three you get particular pixel value and then image is displayed in computer, this is the in general way of representing an image or in simple form see a grey scale image grey scale image means zero to two fifty five each pixel will have only value from zero to two fifty five, zero means black and two fifty five means white s whatever number if you are getting will be between black and white only. So there will be only one matrix one matrix you can imagine of let say five one two cross five one two and each cell will contain value from zero to two fifty five only so it’s a matrix of the computer sees it as a matrix only and if you know matrix operations easily you can do a lot of things with that with that image that’s what image processing people do they see it is in matrix and then they do lot of things with that then enhancement another processing is very
 
feasible with images so let me do a little bit of math with this numpy library so that we get comfortable with the array operations and matrix operations. Ok let’s see this I have imported numpy I will create one array let’s say x as np dot array ok and let’s say two dimensional list will be there so first is one comma two and second is again three comma four ok and I want it to be float so I will just force it using float not float no dot float that is sixty four bit and another array sorry another array of np dot again two dimensional array so first row is let’s say five comma six and second row is let’s say seven comma eight and again I am forcing it to be float just like that no reason for this just doing it. Float sixty four sixty four bit awesome. Let me see the error first here ok sorry ok so this is awesome let me just run it and I will do all the operations here on my console so its gets easy for me to follow let’s see this. I will just bring x plus y x plus y let me see what it does, is it correct can you see whether the x plus y ok or not? If you see that it has done the element by element addition so the if you see the first matrix the two dimensional the first row was one two and the second row was three four. Thus the second matrix the first row was five six and second row was seven eight if you do the element by element addition element by element means what first row first column that is one comma one is one here and for the second matrix one comma one is five, five plus one gets is six so first element is six, since it is float six point is coming, if I just print x then see y ok same goes for the second element which is which is what eight six plus two is eight and third element is ten seven plus three and the twelve great or you can do what you can just print here what np dot add you can just pass x comma y which is which are matrices will show this in image z. Now let me do some other operations let me subtract this two matrices subtraction means element by element subtraction so what will you write one thing I can write is just print x minus y and it will give me the is it correct? Five minus one is x minus y minus four six minus two four oh my god see minus four minus four it gives the subtraction in minus four minus four great or I can just np dot rather than writing add I can just subtract x comma y and it will give me the same result. What else can you think any arithmetic operations next is of course multiplication so I can just write print x multiplied by y and it will give me the element by element multiplication five into one is five, six into two is twelve, seven into three is twenty one, eight four is thirty two. So eight four is thirty two so I am getting or I can write print again np dot multiply sorry multiply x comma y same result or I can even divide the arrays matrices that is x divide by y will give me x divide by y, you can check the result so this is very easy these I am just showing the basic operations you can do lot of other stuffs in using numpy library so suppose if I want to print np dot sqrt which is square root of let’s say x only, it will give the square root of all the elements one is one this is what four sorry two square root of two is one point four one, then square root of three, square root of four or same thing I can do it for y also it will give me the element value, there are lot of things you can do with this. So this is just to show one thing is that in programming assignments somewhere we ask how to I think in week three or week four maybe I don’t remember, where you have to print the transpose of the matrix nothing else you just have to transport it and print it it’s very easy in numpy so let me just delete this part I don’t want this float value to be hanging on this whole integer to make it very clear let me just run it and see my x ok one two three four is there, now if I want to print the transpose of this matrix x is very easy in numpy I will just print x dot capital t one three four two that’s it you can see one three will become first column will come first row one three two four so if it is small matrix

three cross three or even four cross four it is very easy to do this with the way you have been doing right now suppose the matrix size is let’s say thousand cross thousand literally very time consuming to write the code actually see even in this numpy library in the library behind the code same thing is going on what we are doing it not like it is magic just doing it, the same amount of time it take to do it but it is easy for us to call this and do some operations that’s it nothing else the time actually the same. So, to just reduce the time of the programmer this kind of libraries are build and that’s why python is very popular because actually the time program takes is way higher than other programming languages let’s say c and c plus plus so python takes more than one and a half let’s say one point if a program takes x amount of time, python will take definitely one point five x or may be more than that amount of time because python is just for the programmers to make for programmers to make their life simple that’s it and c is to mostly most of the systems are designed in c plus plus so that they are very efficient and they run very fast. Python is for basically to for the mostly the researchers are doing using python to to do their research and see how their things are working. That’s it. So these libraries are to make the, to make our life very easy and I very less amount of time we can code. Ok there are lot of things let’s say if I want to sum all the elements of this matrix I will just write let me write here print np dot sum and sum of what sum of x it will just print and show me ten four plus two plus three is ten yeah or if I just want to print the sum of first row the sum of first row is just if I want to print the sum of first row I will just np dot sum of tutorial came up x comma x is I will put zero means its sum of all the sorry sum of first column ok so this is the first column this is the second column so column wise it will show first column is three plus one which is four and second column is four plus two which is six so column wise it will give you the result or if I put it x is one then it will show you the row wise so one plus first row is one two so one plus two is three, second row is three four, three plus four is seven so there are lot of other operations which you can do with numpy. I just wanted to give you the how matrix are illustrated in numpy and how we can do lot of operations using numpy on matrixes. So we will be using little bit of numpy library in our next video so this is the very quick tutorial for numpy, you can go through the documents of numpy just goggle it, and many people have written a lot of tutorial on numpy you can just check it, it is very easy to understand and even if you face any problem with the numpy you can just post it on the discussion form. In next video will do something using this numpy on images, Thank you.
DATA COMPRESSION 03
So, we saw some basic functionality on num pad in this video we will see some more of these and after that we will start the next tutorial. So let’s see this let me import it again import the numpy library again so I will write import, import numpy as np so ok so let me create an array so np is equal to what was the command np dot array and then I will give the list which is let say one comma two. Now, I want to I want to know the data type of this data type of this list or this another numbers what is it? I will just print I will just print as x dot dtype that’s it if you run see int thirty two that is thirty two bit int ok suppose I change the array as let’s say this as one point o and this is two point o and now if you run this you see a float sixty four bit so this is a floating point value that’s why data type is showing is float sixty four great. Suppose you want to be force it to be something else you saw that it was showing int thirty two ok and if I want it to be it t be a sixty four suppose I want more values there which I know can be represented in sixty four bit only I need more numbers more numbers means more digits I mean more binary value I need so I can represent a big number. Suppose I want sixty four bit number to be represented so I need to force my data type to be a sixty four bit so what will I do I will create an array np dot array ok I will give the sorry I will give the list which I say one comma two and I will force it as dtype is equal to np dot int sixty four ok ok and now if I type print x dot dtype you see now it showing sixty four now it is allocated sixty four bit to represent these values, now you can if number which is as big as which can only be represented by sixty four bit binary numbers then you can represent it to before that you would have try to represented to would have been showing some overflow value or some other value. So you can force the number to represent in sixty four bit or even thirty two bit. Great now the best part of numpy is that why we use in post video that I told you that the main reason of using numpy is mostly to do some operations with array and matrix mostly matrix so matrix operations are very very easy in numpy and in most of the machine learning aI based technologies mostly it is matrix operations only. If you see an image it is basically nothing bunch of pixels represented in a matrix form so suppose you see a you see an image of let say five one two cross five one two and the height is five one two and the width is five one two if you read the image in a computer you see a matrix of actually you see a matrix three dimension matrix actually n cross p whatever so three dimensional matrix will be there and each with the size of one two cross five one two why three dimensional matrix because it contains rgb values red green and blue. And each cell of the matrix will contain a value which is between zero to two fifty five representing what range of red it is, what range of blue it is and what range of green it is then mixing all this three you get particular pixel value and then image is displayed in computer, this is the in general way of representing an image or in simple form see a grey scale image grey scale image means zero to two fifty five each pixel will have only value from zero to two fifty five, zero means black and two fifty five means white s whatever number if you are getting will be between black and white only. So there will be only one matrix one matrix you can imagine of let say five one two cross five one two and each cell will contain value from zero to two fifty five only so it’s a matrix of the computer sees it as a matrix only and if you know matrix operations easily you can do a lot of things with that with that image that’s what image processing people do they see it is in matrix and then they do lot of things with that then enhancement another processing is very
 
feasible with images so let me do a little bit of math with this numpy library so that we get comfortable with the array operations and matrix operations. Ok let’s see this I have imported numpy I will create one array let’s say x as np dot array ok and let’s say two dimensional list will be there so first is one comma two and second is again three comma four ok and I want it to be float so I will just force it using float not float no dot float that is sixty four bit and another array sorry another array of np dot again two dimensional array so first row is let’s say five comma six and second row is let’s say seven comma eight and again I am forcing it to be float just like that no reason for this just doing it. Float sixty four sixty four bit awesome. Let me see the error first here ok sorry ok so this is awesome let me just run it and I will do all the operations here on my console so its gets easy for me to follow let’s see this. I will just bring x plus y x plus y let me see what it does, is it correct can you see whether the x plus y ok or not? If you see that it has done the element by element addition so the if you see the first matrix the two dimensional the first row was one two and the second row was three four. Thus the second matrix the first row was five six and second row was seven eight if you do the element by element addition element by element means what first row first column that is one comma one is one here and for the second matrix one comma one is five, five plus one gets is six so first element is six, since it is float six point is coming, if I just print x then see y ok same goes for the second element which is which is what eight six plus two is eight and third element is ten seven plus three and the twelve great or you can do what you can just print here what np dot add you can just pass x comma y which is which are matrices will show this in image z. Now let me do some other operations let me subtract this two matrices subtraction means element by element subtraction so what will you write one thing I can write is just print x minus y and it will give me the is it correct? Five minus one is x minus y minus four six minus two four oh my god see minus four minus four it gives the subtraction in minus four minus four great or I can just np dot rather than writing add I can just subtract x comma y and it will give me the same result. What else can you think any arithmetic operations next is of course multiplication so I can just write print x multiplied by y and it will give me the element by element multiplication five into one is five, six into two is twelve, seven into three is twenty one, eight four is thirty two. So eight four is thirty two so I am getting or I can write print again np dot multiply sorry multiply x comma y same result or I can even divide the arrays matrices that is x divide by y will give me x divide by y, you can check the result so this is very easy these I am just showing the basic operations you can do lot of other stuffs in using numpy library so suppose if I want to print np dot sqrt which is square root of let’s say x only, it will give the square root of all the elements one is one this is what four sorry two square root of two is one point four one, then square root of three, square root of four or same thing I can do it for y also it will give me the element value, there are lot of things you can do with this. So this is just to show one thing is that in programming assignments somewhere we ask how to I think in week three or week four maybe I don’t remember, where you have to print the transpose of the matrix nothing else you just have to transport it and print it it’s very easy in numpy so let me just delete this part I don’t want this float value to be hanging on this whole integer to make it very clear let me just run it and see my x ok one two three four is there, now if I want to print the transpose of this matrix x is very easy in numpy I will just print x dot capital t one three four two that’s it you can see one three will become first column will come first row one three two four so if it is small matrix

three cross three or even four cross four it is very easy to do this with the way you have been doing right now suppose the matrix size is let’s say thousand cross thousand literally very time consuming to write the code actually see even in this numpy library in the library behind the code same thing is going on what we are doing it not like it is magic just doing it, the same amount of time it take to do it but it is easy for us to call this and do some operations that’s it nothing else the time actually the same.

DATA COMPRESSION 05
Ok, just see this numbers and according to this I am going to write my program let me just ok, let it be there let me just keep some space so that it is visible here ok great awesome so what I am going to do I will loop through the old loop through my old image I will see the values one by one see where it lies in this in these blocks, block number zero block number one two three four up to seven where the numbers are lying and accordingly I will change I will put the pixels in my this new image which is which I have created correspondingly I mean wherever I am getting the number in this image in my old image in that corresponding place of this new image which has created I will put what I am going to assign here so suppose I get a number at let’s say four comma three comma two is one thirty eight one thirty eight lies between one twenty eight to one fifty nine so I will put four at three comma two in this new matrix so this will be my new image so I will write it down I will write the loop for I in range of image dot size, size is two sorry get the size of image zeroth is the row number of ok and for j in range image dot size of I sorry one ok so row and column I am going through each row and of each column and then I will check if the old image is which one the pixel map this is the old image which I have loaded in pixel map so if pixel map ok of I comma j is greater than equal to zero I am checking for the first law if if if the number which I am iterating through ok is greater than equal to zero and ok let me ok let me write this pixel map I comma j and it is greater than zero and it is less than equal to thirty one it means this this particular cell value lies between zero to thirty one if it is the case then you write pixel name pixel new I j as I comma j as what will put zero ok let me just we are going to use this line again and again so let me just copy this ok so I will just put rather than if else if else if, if it is not in the first block the value is not lying between zero to thirty one, if it is lying between thirty two to sixty three then put what one copy this because it is our else if part I will put here else if it is not even in the second block so if it is lying between sixty four to ninety five, ninety five is our third block I will put two ok and if it is not there then if it is between ninety six to one twenty seven, one twenty seven, ninety six to one twenty seven is my fourth block so I will put three ok and if it is not there but it is between one twenty eight to one fifty nine then I will put four they’re ok it an if it is between if it is not there but in between one sixty to one ninety one then I will put five there and if it is not there but in between one ninety two to two two three two two three I will put six there sorry six there and if it is not there and at last thing which I have to check is if it is between two two four to two fifty five it must be there that’s it my work is done here so I have created this new image I have mapped all my blocks to my original to whatever I wanted to so that I can reduce the size ok now what I am going to do I will just save this image with the command image dot save let me write the name as lena is equal to dot jpg ok I will see the matrix also here I saw the matrix as where did I write oh I removed it ok let me write it again so j let me write it that I will write it j numpy dot as array and image dot I don’t need to open it I can just I already open it there it’s ok lena is equal to dot jpg so I will see this new image as an array and how so my program is complete so let me just run it great so I will saved it let me just check this j you can see all these values have been mapped accordingly if you see this array let me show you one thirty five was a one thirty five was lying between one twenty eight to one fifty nine hence the four is written so all these values all these values if you see it is lying between one twenty eight to one fifty nine
 
that’s why I have mapped it with four so the mapping has been done and I have save the image as the lena dot jpg so I will go to my folder and I will see the image, you can see it its looking black but it’s not exactly black I will open it and you can see that some part its actually visible the image is exactly same if we look at the image here you can see image is exactly the same image if you see the boundary if you see the face eyes everything is same its just that we are trying to represent eight bit image into three bit image that’s why so much we have lost we have lost a lot so it’s looking approximately everything is looking black but still you can see the image lining all the edges all the other things are exactly the same so this is compression and if you see the size, size of first image was forty two kb this is just four kb four point eight six kb it is reduced a lot lot ok so this is one type of compression which you can achieve through this just simple naive method there are lot of lot of tons of method for image compression and it is it still a hot topic people have still working on this compression technique. If you see the this image format for example jpg these are also compression techniques and how to represent an image in an very in a very efficient way so that it takes less time but the quality is not compromised so this we just wanted to give you a motivation give you a motivation of image compression and compression in general that’s why we shoed this example. You can check out different algorithms for compression and you can even discuss about that those algorithms in the discussion form so that we can we can give you inputs and also we can learn about that. So this was just to motivate you guys how you can how it is simple to see these things through the first principle and achieve such kind of things so it looks like that compression is what exactly is going on the compression when we do the zip and rar of some files and then we see that the size of file reduce and we just copy it or we just send it on email but we don’t understand how to what exactly is going on. So these simple methods are actually used in the background to compress those files so image compression is a very hot topic and there are very many ways through which you can compress the image and actually people see the way people study the way we pursue image on based on those studies they do the compression and it is actually it has been very successful venture through this. So please discuss about this technique in discussion form and ask question if you have any. Thank you.
