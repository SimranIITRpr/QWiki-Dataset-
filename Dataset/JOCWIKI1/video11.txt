BROWSER AUTOMATION: WATSAPP USING PYTHON 01
So, we are coming to the flag end of the course and I need to note something, we have tried sowing roughly twenty four saplings so far as different joys in computing and this saplings will grow on to trees by that I mean we have only introduced the concepts the naive way, in fact for every single concept that we have taught there is an advanced version you to look into it and of course we will help you out if u can ask us for more details, now going ahead with the next joy you all know how watsapp works, ever wondered how to automate it? This very process is called the browser automation so let’s see how you can automate watsapp messages by learning this concept called browser automation.
BROWSER AUTOMATION: WATSAPP USING PYTHON 02
Hello all, welcome to yet another programming screen cast of joy of computing. This programming screen cast is about browser automation. So first of all let me tell you what is browser automation? As the name suggest I need to automate my browser, if I need to automate my browser I should use browser automation. This is very much possible in python and this is a very easy task to do in python. Suppose I open a website and I click on some links, whatever I do there I need to automate that so in order to automate all the things that I do on a website I need to write a script for it and this script will use python will use the browser automation library of python so whatever I am doing manually here I need to automate it, how can I do that? Well python your rescue will be using a library of python called selenium yes I repeat the library is called selenium so first of all let us install selenium library so please open your terminal window and write pep install selenium so I will be doing that I will just write pep install selenium s e l e n I u m ok so I will just click enter since I have already install selenium library it is showing the output as requirement already satisfied so I will request all of you to install it I have already installed it that’s why it is saying requirement already satisfied so first you need to do here is to install selenium library by using the command pep install selenium now that we are done with installing the selenium library there is one more requirement you need to install here so there are different web drivers available for different browsers for example if you are using goggle chrome there is a separate web driver, if you are using safari there is a separate web driver and if you are using Firefox there is separate web driver so what you need to do here is you just go to Google and you type installation installing web driver for chrome I will be using chrome here so I will use the chrome driver here so the web driver for Google chrome is called chrome drivers so I will just write chrome so there are different links here so go to the download section we have the chrome driver here I will just click here please download the latest version of the chrome driver and it is two point four two as if I click here it will download the concerned web driver for chrome since I have already installed it will not install it, I have shown you the way how can you install a web driver for chrome similarly you can install web driver for other browsers. If you are using safari you can download that for safari too and if you are using Firefox you can download for Firefox too. I just show you so you just need to go to Google and you now need to type install web driver for safari I will say safari so in the download section you have the different web driver for safari too so you can download the safari web driver too if you are using safari so please keep this fact in mind there are different web drivers for different web browsers so you need to install the respective web driver for the web browser that you are using. So now we have now you are done with the installation process first of all we install the selenium library that is used for the browser automation in python and then we also installed the web driver which is also user browser automation so I request all of you to install these two things before proceeding to the programming screen cast.
BROWSER AUTOMATION: WATSAPP USING PYTHON 03
Welcome again to the programming screen cast of browser automation, I hope you have gone through the previous videos and you have installed the two requirements required for browser automation. First of all you need to install the selenium library and second thing you need to install respective web drivers for your web browsers so if you have these two let us go ahead with the programming screen cast of the browser automation. In this particular screen cast I will be giving you limbs of what browser automation is all about and how can selenium library would help us in doing that. So as and always I will import the selenium library I will just write from selenium I need to import web driver import web driver sorry it is web driver so if it doesn’t show any error that means your selenium library has installed successfully, if it doesn’t show any error that means your selenium library has been installed successfully and if it does show an error that means you need to install you need to check whether your selenium library has been installed or not. So in my case it is not showing any error so that means the selenium library has installed successfully after that I need to initialise the web my driver here so I will take a variable here I will just write browser, browser is just a variable name, you can take any other variable name here since I have imported the web driver I will write web driver dot chrome and in bracket I need to supply the path of my chrome driver I repeat I need to supply the path of my chrome driver here in my case I have installed the chrome driver in downloads so I will just go to downloads and click get info here so here I have the path of chrome driver so I will just copy this and paste here the name of the chrome driver is chrome driver hyphen two so I will just write chrome driver hyphen two I will now click enter here see this is working, the moment I initialise the web driver it is opening the google chrome web browser so it depends on your web driver, whatever web driver you have installed if you initialise that particular web driver it will open your respective web browser in my case it was chrome driver so it is opening the google chrome window here so now we are done with the initialising the web driver, web driver is basically used to open the web browser so I use the web driver to open my google chrome window so next thing what you need to do here is suppose I want to open a particular web site in my google chrome web browser so how can you do that? You will just write browser dot get and in brackets you write the name of that particular website so here I will be just opening the website of selenium library so I just write https colon slash www dot selenium HQ dot org so let us see whether it works or not? So as you can see the selenium the selenium website has been opened there in the goggle chrome web browser window I will show you side by side so you can get the clear idea of how this is working. So here I have the goggle chrome window and on the right hand side I have my ipython console so I will close it again and I will show you how this is working, here I have the Google chrome window here I have the ipython console I will I will execute this statement again since we have already close the window it is not working so I will again initialise my browser window here I will click ok now the it has open now let me open this particular webpage I will click enter so you see the selenium hq dot org has been opened here, you see I didn’t do anything here I didn’t write these particular address in the address bar of my web browser but it has opened automatically I have written a script here in my ipython console so what you need to do here is first of all you need to initialise your web driver after that you can open any web page using the address of that particular web
 
page and this is browser automation and this is called browser automation so now we are done with it, I will be giving you one or two examples of how can you automate your browser using your selenium library now that we have opened the selenium web page suppose I want to click on this link name download how can you do that using browser automation, this is very much possible in python let me show you how can you do that. So I will just go t my ipython console and I will write variable name here it is elem is equal to browser dot find element underscore by link text by underscore link underscore text and the link text here is downloads so I will supply the link name here is download it should be same as the link in the web page and if it is in upper case you should write it in upper case if it is in lower case you should write it in lower case so I will just click enter here so elem stores the particular length to download and now if I write elem dot click it should click on the download link so I will just click enter, you see the download link has been opened here so this is very much possible in python and very much easy to automate your browser so this is how you can open a particular link on your web page you just used to use the method find element by link text and using that you can click on any particular link and you can you can automate your browser. So we are done with this now if you need to write something in this search bar how can you do that? Well this is also very much possible in python. For that you need to double click on your web page and you need to select the inspect option here. Double click on the web page and you need to select the inspect option here I will just do that till open a window like this which has elements, consoles, sources, network well you need not go into the details I will show you here in this you need to know the id of this particular search bar. How can you do that? As you click on this particular statement it will show you the it will show you the concerned area, here we have the body ok so there I will click here and it will show me the particular elements present on the web page if I keep on clicking on this statements so I need to go to the search bar I will search the search bar here where it is present I think it is present here, so I will just click the down arrow after that here it is header I need to search the header only because the search is in header bar I will just click here, here I have the id no I need to search the edit page no I need to search this search selenium yes it has come to search selenium and here you can see it is showing that label for q and here I need to write in this particular text box its id is q as you can see here input type is equal to text id is equal to q and if I take my mouse there it is showing me that this particular id corresponds to this particular text box as you can see this particular id is corresponding to this particular text box so the id is q so I will just go to the my ipython console and I will write search that is again an variable name search is equal to browser dot now I need to find the element by id so I will write find underscore element underscore by underscore id and the id is here q simply q so I will just press enter here so in search I have the text box and to search I need to send some key so I will just write search dot send keys whatever I need to send there off course I need to search the download so I will just write download it send underscore keys download ok let me click enter here let us see whether it is working or not, see it has the download thing written here in the search box I will just close it as you can see it has the download text written here in search box I didn’t do anything I just wrote a script and automated by browser and as you can see browser automation is a very easy thing to do in python and it is very very interesting too, you can do a lot of things using browser automation, this is just step of the ice berg so now we are done with that. So I will just go one

by one what we did in this programming screen cast. First of all we imported the web driver from selenium after that I initialise the browser variable here in which I supplied the web driver path after that what we did we opened a particular web page using the browser automation using selenium library after that we opened the link using find element by link text after that what we did at last we search we search for the text box in the in the inspect element. How can you do that? I will show you again that it becomes clear to you, what we need to do? You need to double click on your web page after that you need to select the inspect option here inspect option it will show you a window here and if you keep if you over your mouse it will also show what this particular element corresponds to this particular element in web page for example in this particular case the body it corresponds to the all of web page and if I click the down arrow here I have the various element I need to search for the search text box I click on div id is equal to container here after that I have different elements first of all it is header then it is m body then it is footer as the search box is in header I just click that down arrow of that header after that I need to go to the particular text box so what I do here is I click on this id is equal to search box after that as you can see you keep on clicking on you keep on clicking on the down arrows and you will get this search box this is the label for the search box and then if I click here input type is equal to text and id is equal to q here it is showing the particular text box so this is concerned text box that we are looking for so its id is q so we have used the method find element by id and I have stored this particular element in search variable after that I clicked after that I sent keys to this particular text box I send the text download and as you can see it has written that particular text in the search text box so this is how you can automate your browser and I will advise you to explore more in browser automation as this is a very interesting topic. So in the next programming screen cast I will tell you how can automate your watsapp using browser automation.
BROWSER AUTOMATION: WATSAPP USING PYTHON 04
Hello all, in the previous programming screen cast we saw some interesting things you can do with browser automation, this is clearly very interesting topic to do in python. Here in this particular programming screen cast as I said earlier I will be teaching you how can you automate your watsapp using browser automation. And for that what you need to do here is as and always you need this selenium library as well as you need the web driver here too will be using the web watsapp to automate your watsapp so what you can do with watsapp automation? For example you need to send hundred messages to your friends or to your any other particular group you can do that using python you don’t need to write the message again and again, you can just use, a for loop and your friends using watsapp using browser automation, well I will advise you not to do that, I will be giving you glimpse of how can you do that using python. So first of all let me write let me write from selenium, selenium import web driver as we did in the last programming screen cast. After that you have to import two or three things here so I will just write from selenium dot web driver dot support dot uI import web driver wait after that you need to import from selenium dot web driver dot support. Import expected underscore conditions as ec next you need to import from selenium dot web driver dot common dot keys import keys after that again one more thing from selenium dot web driver dot common dot by import by next you need to import the time library so that now we are done with importing the concerned libraries so after that I will just write I need to initialise my driver so I will just write driver here I am using the variable driver in the previous programming screen cast we used browser here I am using driver in order to show you can use any sort of variable name so I will just write is equal to web driver dot chrome and as explained in the previous programming screen cast you need to supply the path to your web driver here I have the web driver in my downloads folder so I will just write the path here. It’s in users simran setia downloads and in downloads I have the chrome driver chrome driver hyphen two. Then I need to open the watsapp window so I will just write driver dot get and you need to supply the web address here so I will just write https colon slash web dot watsapp dot com I will also write wait is equal to wait web driver wait is equal to web driver wait driver it will wait for some six hundred time units and first of all we will run this and see how the watsapp appears magically through this and yes your only watsapp account will appear in it. How can you do that? Let me see, let me run it. I will just write watsapp using python dot py so it’s basically capital w please look at it this, this is capital w not small w so I will run it again it cannot import keys, keys is again capital k I am really sorry for that as you can see the web drover is doing its job it is opening the concerned web browser. So let me open it awesome as you can see you have the watsapp window right here in your chrome browser you can also see there is a QR code here so I would request all of you to go to your settings in your watsapp and then click watsapp web slash desktop. If you click here you will get an option to scan QR code please click on the scan QR code and scan the QR concerned QR code here. I just did that and as you can see you will have my watsapp window here, as you can see you have my watsapp window here and what next we need to do here is I need to send some hundred messages to my friend so how can you do that using browser automation? And this is very much possible using selenium so what you need to do here is first of all you need to supply a target you need to supply a target frame whom you
 
want to send these messages. So I will just write target is equal to first of all you need to write the single quotes and then in double quotes you need to supply the name of your friend so I need to send messages to Ravi kiran so I will just write Ravi kiran and then you need to write the string the message that you have to send to your friend so I will just write message sent using python, this is the message that you need to send so I will just write the comments here enter your friends name enter your friends name here the message you need to send to your friend you need to send to your friend. So please take care of these two things according to your watsapp after that what you need to do here is as in the previous programming screen cast we located the download link we also located the search text box using the methods like find element by id or find element by length text. In this same way in your watsapp window what you need to do, you need to locate the particular message box the particular message of your target friend here I just wrote ravi kiran so here I have the ravi kiran I have ravi kiran message bow I need to locate this particular message box using this inspect to so how can you do that? You just double click here and click on the inspect option after that you can see you have the different elements and different elements stock here now I need to locate ravi kiran here how can you do that? As and always we will start with the body here we have the body of this particular web page then click the down arrow and then click again as you can see there is no particular thing for this message box here we have the different message box under the span tack I repeat here we have the different message box in this span tack if you have anything in this span than how can you locate it I will just show you how can you locate the particular message tag or how can you locate a particular element if it is under span tag instead of div tag please note this fact in the previous programming screen cast located elements that were under dif tab but here we have the different elements located in this spanded so how can you do that? This is very much simple in the case of span, so how can you do this using python so I will just write variable here is s underscore arg is equal to inverted commas slash slash span and in span you write contains at title, title is an attribute here what title are we looking for? We are looking for the target so I will just write target I will just close the inverted commas here and I will write target, target plus space inverted commas then round braces then square braces so we are done with it after that you need to write target is equal to wait dot until ex dot presence as you can see you have the presence of element located yes you need to use this presence of element located element underscore located so how you need to locate the element! Using x arg and x path so I will write by dot x path comma x underscore arg that has been supplied here then you need to close the braces when this is done you need to click on that particular target, target dot click this function has been alternate used in the previous programming screen cast target dot click now we have this target is equal to wait dot until ec dot presence of element located. So I will just check it then there should be two braces not one so what does this function do? This function locates for the particular target which we have supplied in x underscore arg and it will keep on locate till it doesn’t find it so there are is a function for it that is wait dot until we will be using this function to locate that particular target. Now it will click on that particular target so let us run this programme again and see whether it is clicking on that particular friends message box or not so it will again give me a QR code so I need to scan this QR code again so as my watsapp appears so as you can see it is not clicking on that particular target it may be we did some mistake here, here we have some mistake target is equal to when it takes two positional

arguments but three were given so let me check where is the problem we need to supply one extra brace here one extra brace here so let me run it again. I need to scan the QR code again in order to check whether it is clicking in the supply target or not here we have the watsapp as you can see it has clicked on that particular message box ravi kiran’s message box as you can see on the screen so it is working the code till here is working what next we need to do here, after that now I have clicked the target and the next thing is to send the messages to those to that target, for sending messages I need to locate the text box for sending the messages I need to locate the text box and in this particular thing how can we locate the text box? You have various methods like finding the element by id or finding the element by link text in this particular thing we will be using find element by class yes how can you find element by class? Again go to your watsapp window and click on inspect. How can you inspect it? So I will be using that particular method there is it there we have the body then I will be clicking here I need to locate the message box, so how can you locate that? Here I will click here where is the message box, yes I need this particular window after that click the down arrow again no I don’t need it no, where is the message box? Yes in footer we have the message box so click on this down arrow after this, no I need to locate this particular message box and then this so as you can see it is under class underscore one p lpp underscore p llp as you can see here div tab index is equal to minus one class is this. So I will be using this particular class to look at the text box so how can you do that? I will name it as input box sorry I will write I will name it as input underscore box is equal to driver dot find element by class by class name underscore name and you need to supply the class name here so it is underscore one plpp underscore one plpp this is how you can locate any particular element using the method find element by class name. So next is I need to send messages so I will just type for I in range fifty let me annoy me friend by sending fifty messages and then I will write input dot not send keys and in that I should write this string and after writing this string I should also press enter so I will write keys dot enter keys dot enter so I think we are done with the code so let me run it and check whether it is working or not. So we will have the watsapp window here again, let me scan the QR code again now that I have scanned my watsapp window as appeared as you can see I am able to send fifty messaged to my friend ravi Kiran and I am sure he will be very annoyed with me what I am doing here, anyways I will explain it so what cool method I have discovered to annoy him, so in this way you can send various messages many messages to your friend and annoy them I would recommend you not to do that but it’s your wish so this is how you can automate your browser and you can make your browser do many things using selenium and by just writing this script so now that we are done with it now I will go through the program again. First of all you need to import all these libraries here and I have already mentioned that web driver is a web driver is the library that you need to import from selenium after that you need to supply the path of your web driver in my case it was download so I just supplied the path of downloads and chrome driver too this is how you can do it. Next you need to supply the web address here as we wanted to automate our watsapp so we used web dot watsapp then you supplied the wait parameter if you want your web driver to wait in case in case of slow internet connection the web browser doesn’t responds sometimes so this will help in tacking that from tackling that scenario the wait parameter here. After that you need to supply your friends name and then you need to supply the message that you need to send to your friend. Next you need to locate the message box of

your friend in order to locate the message box of your friend you need to locate the span tag here because it comes under the span tag, span tag is basically collections of elements so you need to locate the particular message box using the attribute title. After locating that message box you will supply the wait parameter here again so your program will wait until the presence of that particular element is found or not and then you need to click on that particular message box and then you need to click on that target then you need to locate the input box that is box two for that you will be using diff tag for using the diff tag we have shown the various methods like find element by class name, find element by link text and also find the element by id in this particular thing we use the class name in this particular thing the class name is underscore one elpt it may be different for you guys so I have shown you how can you locate a particular element using the inspect tool you can do that. After that one what number of messaged you want to send you can have a for loop and then you need to send keys to that text box first of all the message you need to send and one thing more you need to press enter after you write the message so I just write keys dot enter I just wrote keys dot enter that’s how you can press enter in browser automation so as you can see me did this and my friend is actually annoyed with this because I send this fifty messages to him so as you can see we send this fifty messages by using browser automation. I hope that this programming screen cast was clear to all of you, if you have any problem please post on discussion form will be happy to help you thank you.
FUN WITH CALENDAR 01
Our next joy is what next goes by the name calendar arithmetic. Some of us are very bad with calendars you know what I mean. It’s very difficult to note what day it is? What time it is? And assuming you are calling a friend who is staying abroad you find it very difficult to figure out what time zone is he in and what could be the time there and is it right to call at this time or not correct? So our next joy is going to be exploring what one means by calendar arithmetic.
FUN WITH CALENDAR 02
Hello guys, welcome to this programming screen cast on fun with calendars so in this joy will be answering some questions regarding calendars and time that is date and time will be answering some questions regarding calendar and time that is sometimes that may even turn to be tricky as well so let me give an example to say why do I say it’s tricky. For example assume that suppose your spouse asks you a question, do you remember the day on which I am born? See she is very intelligent she is not asking you the date because most of the people what they do to is to remember that they would set their passwords to date of birth of their spouse something like that they do so even spouses are becoming intelligent they don’t ask for the date they are born, they are asking the day on which they were born. If such a question is post to you what will you do? You as a life partner you are suppose to remember it that’s what they expect from you but as a human it is difficult for us to remember this and also in India if you see it’s not just about you and your spouse it’s about very big family comprising of your family members your spouse family members your children and so on so that a and this is a very big list if you see an Indian family scenario. So its humanly impossible for us to remember days and even come this involves this many people, so remembering dates itself difficult in that case if they specifically ask what is the day, what will you do. Is there a easy way? Can python help you relief from such situations, is there an easy way? Let’s explore that in this joy. This is not the only question we are going to explore, we will be exploring some more cool questions as well so we will see them in detail as we go by so before going I will say what are the libraries that we will be using in this joy that makes our life simpler the libraries that I will be using are you can see the list here its calendar, date time, pytz tz stands for time zone so this is the hint I am giving so just guess what would I be having in my mind of what task can we doing with python and time zone given the word time zone what can we be doing let’s keep this suspense for now, I will reveal it slowly and before getting it into the actual task we will explore these libraries will see some basic tasks that may help you in understanding the task that we planned to do with this python libraries. You will be seeing pre requisites that are required for you to do the task needed in this joy in the next part of the video.
FUN WITH CALENDAR 03
Alright guys, I just post you a question that you would have faced in your in your real life or you would have heard of someone saying that I face such a situation. So in this joy we are going to tell you away by which you can quickly get relied from such tricky situations before getting into that actually as I had said we will be seeing the pre requisites that is needed so the libraries that I have said so for we will go with them one by one so the first thing is I want to current time, so how would I do that? So I would say I need the current time that’s my first that’s the first thing I am going to do current time is what I am going to do now. So for getting the current time we will be using this package date time as you had seen in the previous video the package is from that the date time package has the feature by which we can get the current time so we will be importing it date time is a bigger package from date time from that bigger package we will be importing a smaller subset of it even that is named as date time so get used to this also date time is a lengthier name so let me abbreviate it as dt just for our convenience sake so this is the way I have imported day time is a bigger package it has sub packages if you just want to work with dates you have something called date if you just want to work with time you have something called time and you have a lot of things or maybe you can think of it may be I will say let me say import day time let me say I have imported so if I say day time dot and I press a tab see I have plenty of options that is available time time, time zones so many options are available this is the name package that we have so ok I don’t need this date time actually I want the sub set day time this is the super set I want the sub set so let me do this again so that this particular thing that is imported now I want to display the current time how would I do that? Simple dt dot now that’s it see this is the current time two thousand eighteen ten four sixteen ten thirty three and this is the mille seconds count so that is fourth October two thousand eighteen the time is sixteen minutes it is given in twenty four hour format evening four ten thirty three seconds and this many number of mille seconds so this gives in this precession and let us see what happens if we print it, so if I say print day time dot now if I print it let us say see it is given in a lightly organised format compared to giving in a individual value in a tupple format as you could see it returns a sort of tupple format now it is giving in a organised format and you could see this is reverse we generally we write it as four ten two thousand eighteen and if you have used some software like excel and all you are supposed to give the month first followed by the date, it should be ten four it should be ten four not four ten if you use such packages it is giving entirely in the reverse format why is this so? This is the format generally followed in the data bases when you store data value in data bases it will first store the year then the month then the date so you would have heard that computers generally are comfortable processing from right to left right so if you see right to left it is the human friendly format so probably this is the reason why data bases use this storage representation so the same representation is adopted here as well so first comes the year then the month then the date it’s just the reverse of what humans are doing generally and time comes this way sixteen hours that is evening four o clock eleven minutes eleven seconds and these many numbers of Millie seconds that’s the time so now this is how we got the current time so this is nothing but the system time whatever was the time here in my system this is the same time being fixed that is when this
 
instruction was executed this was the this was the exact time of the clock in my system that’s being fetched here.
FUN WITH CALENDAR 04
Alright guys, in the previous video we had seen how we can fetch the current system time may be will have a very quick recap of that too because we will be seeing and extension of it basically from so let me give a recap from date time that is a super set import the sub set date time given the name is big let me abbreviate it as dt and to get the time what did I do I said print dt dot now what is the name now is displayed, fourth October two thousand eighteen sixteen twenty two four twenty two seventeen minutes these many Millie seconds this is the time. Alright so if I want to know the time in other locations say Singapore, America or whatever I want to know the time so what should I do? So they follow something called an time zone so as you know the standard time that is calculated by the green witch meridian in your school geography you would have studied using the green witch meridian that zero degree longitude is taken as the standard and time is calculated and our Indian time is gmt that is gmt green witch mean time that is the standard timer standard time that is considered and from that gmt our Indian time is heard by five hours and thirty minutes gmt plus five thirty is our time zone like that there are different time zones so I want to know what is the time zone of in that time zone of Singapore. So what should I do? Here I need to work with time zones right so I need to import something called a time zone I need to use something called a time zone for that I need to import the package pytz import py py for python and tz for time zone so I had imported it and now I need to create the time zone object this is how python works, you can know more of what is an object and of all if you had studied course called object oriented programming you would have an idea if not also you will be learning it that’s very simple it’s not a rocket science you can quickly learn it just know that something like time zone special thing something if you want to work with time zone you need to create some special object this object you are going to create it now. So how would you create it? Simple pytz dot time zone what is the time zone you want to know that you have to give it as an argument here, you have to give it as argument I said Singapore so let me say Singapore. Singapore is the this thing I want to know so I have created a time zone object that is I want to know the time in this particular time zone of Singapore whatever is the time zone followed that is time is followed here I want to know this particular time so I have created an object and now simple just I have been printing right printing the time right with this I need to pass this object time zone so if I pass this object time as per Singapore it is displayed it is eighteen it is evening six o clock fifty five minutes thirteen seconds these many Millie seconds so this is plus zero eight is nothing but gmt plus eight hours, hours is Indian time is gmt plus five thirty right so two and half hours Singapore is ahead of India so gmt plus eight hours so this is how the time is displayed so you can give up specific time zone and know it and so how would I know what I just know the country I don’t know the time zone what if that is the case, you can always look it up like they have name the time zones differently our Indian time zones is named as Asia Kolkata so they had given some time zones they had just given the name for the country for some time zones they had given some prominent cities in that country as the identifier name something like that this is the identifier Singapore is not the this is not the time in Singapore in and around Singapore whatever is the countries that follow this time zone this time there so this is the identifier for the time zone region Singapore is an identifier for some regions they have given the country name for some they have given the
 
prominent city name in the country and for some they have separated with continent followed by the name of the city or country or whatever that’s how they had given they are different time zones they are defined in python so you have to give that specific value here what if I don’t know the time zones that are present in python. How will I get the list of all time zones present in python simple even that is defined already, simple you just need to type pytz dot all underscore time zone time zones just type it see you got a list you got a list of all time zones see oh my god there are so many I am not able to understand where it starts there are so many so ok let me do a thing let me see how many are present there is a list right so we want to know how many are present there so I will use the functionality length so let me use it let me say length of this list five ninety one five hundred times of five hundred plus time zones are supported here in python so may be there may be some variations if you have because in my Linux system I remember getting some five seventy range answer in windows version there is five ninety one may be there is an update software or whatever be that when you are trying there may be a variation if there is an update you will see an different number but currently these many time zones are being supported in python so these are the different time zones so here you can look it up as to what is the time zone that you see pacific, Portugal, Poland, Singapore, turkey you have different things so you can look it up as through what this is, what is the time zone that you want to know so green which is the standard time so Greenwich is our midpoint and all these are behind gmt and all these are ahead of gmt so will get something like that oh no there are arranged in ascending orders I am sorry for this I am sorry for the info if that is the case then India should have come there given that I didn’t spot India realise that they have arranged that in alphabetical order so the alphabetical order they have arranged the names see Asia Kolkata is our Indian time zone you could see it here Asia Kolkata this is our Indian time zone, Asia kualalumpur is for Malaysia Kuwait you have a lot KarachI Pakistan, Kabul, Jerusalem you have a lot you can see through the list there are some five hundred plus time zones so this is how you will be working with the time zone basically you will create something called as time zone object and pass that object to your day time dot now functionality you will be passing it, to get the time as per that time zone so in that case what was the output let us see. Just revisit it once we had created an object and now we want to print it, what is an output? Its gives the date time and it says what is the difference from gmt plus zero right means its eight hours ahead of gmt so that’s what is known from here that’s what is the output that is earthling just that you need to create an time zone object and just pass it through the now functionality this is how you deal with different time zones. Alright guys the question that I have addressed initially the suspense and is given a date how would you find which day it falls on that still pending right we will see that in the next part of the video.
FUN WITH CALENDAR 05
Alright guys, so in the previous videos I had post you a question and I have we had seen some we have been slowly proceeding to answer that question. So we have seen how can we get the current time from the system also we have seen how to work with different time zones and how to get the current time as per that time zones. So we had seen all those in the previous videos. So now will address that question given a date how would you know on what date of the week it falls, so that is done by using a library calendar let me import it import calendar if you need you can use a shorter name using as key word you can abbreviate it you needed I just use it as the same as it is calendar so there is a functionality here as you would see, calendar dot see so many functionalities come if you would just give a question mark I guess by this time you would be familiar with this so I have been skipping that part that if you need a help of what this particular command is just type the command and put a question mark at the end you will get to know what is that particular command so isleap, leap days so many search functionalities are there see you have a lot of functionalities alright week day this used to be of some use to me so let me ask what this functionality does. Let me ask see the signature is calendar dot week day year month day year, month, day from nineteen seventy you need to pass some years and in month between one to twelve date between one to thirty one you need to pass it and it returns the week days zero to six which denoted Monday to Sunday it is zero is for Monday, one is for Tuesday, two is for Wednesday, three is for Thursday, four is for Friday, six is for Saturday sorry, five is for Saturday, six is for Sunday so just enumerated from zero to six there are seven numbers there are seven days just write it from Sunday to Monday this is how they have mapped it and it will give the corresponding index of the days, so this is how they have implemented this functionality so let us experiment with it calendar dot week day we need to give the year let me say the same year two thousand two thousand eighteen it is some month so let me say July some day someday let me say sixth July what is the day on sixth July? It’s says four, four is nothing but is zero is Monday, one is Tuesday, three is Wednesday, four is Thursday so this day sixth July two thousand eighteen was a Thursday it says same like this you can change the different dates and time and you can see it and if you could see it says zero to six is this it may be trickier it may be really urgent so we need to do something for this right so we will do that in our programming screen cast. How can we do that? And also there is some more intercases that’s need to be looked into will see that in the upcoming part if videos.
FUN WITH CALENDAR: 06
Alright guys, so in the previous videos we had seen some functionality this library will offer that will be helpful for us in achieving our task so that we will be doing two tasks in this joy. So let’s go ahead with the tasks one, task one is given a date, can you tell what day of the week it falls on? Is it a Monday or Tuesday or a Wednesday or whatever what is the day of the week that particular day falls on? Input is a date output is you have to tell what day it falls on. That is what we want to program we want to model it. So what is the library that we will be using, we had seen in the pre requisites as well we have the library calendar and we have a functionality week day that actually returns you the day on which the particular date falls so before this we need to see how to get the day because humans have different format of inputting dates I can say three Jan two thousand seventeen three one two thousand seventeen in excel it is one three two thousand seventeen there are different formats so how to take the input format that is something we need to agree upon as well as there are some more things so let us see that ok. So this is the procedure first thing is you need to input a valid date so what do I mean by a valid date? If I say forty seven two thousand eighteen it’s an invalid date, none of the months have the date called forty probably I wanted to type four and it’s a typo it had become forty in such cases we have to handle it so that has to be taken care of as well as if I say thirty one nine two thousand seventeen, is it a valid date? No because nine is the month September it has use thirty days so few months have thirty days few have thirty one days as well as any month the date will never exceed thirty one that thing has to be taken care of also just not just month place a role here year place a role here if it is a leap year there are three sixty six days in that year otherwise you have three sixty five days so that extra days is accounted in the month of February so if it is a leap year February may have twenty nine days and otherwise you will have twenty eight days so you cannot give a bound that thirty or thirty one if I say thirty February that’s not a valid date right so I get reminded of comedy that comes person says that I will repay my loan by thirtieth of February something like that such things if a person is giving such a input to your computer if your program is given such an input your program must be robot enough handle all these things so will have to check if the inputted date is the valid date otherwise you need to keep getting the inputs as long as he doesn’t give the valid date don’t stop getting input o say that it is an invalid same keep getting inputs, if you get a valid date stop and use the built in functionality and get the week day also another problem that we had seen it returns the index of the day zero to six it’s difficult n human minds to say what day this is we are comfortable with Monday Tuesday representation not with zero to six representation. So we need to do some inter conversion here as well even that as to be taken care of. So we will see one by one what is the thing So first we will see about the valid dates, will see ok so as I had said this month of February is a special month if it is a leap year you have twenty nine days else you have twenty eight days else and what about the other months? Ok so the month of February is a special month you have to decide how many number of days are present based on the year if it is a leap year or not a leap year right so how would you determine if it is a leap year or not a leap year. I hope you are familiar with this procedure you had seen in your birthday paradox joy so still let us revisit it. How would you detect a leap year? If it is a century year, what do I mean by century year? It is a beginning of a century beginning of a new century something like that
 
how would you detect in simple words it ends with two zeros. The year sixteen hundred, seventeen hundred, eighteen hundred two thousand all these are century years. If it is a century year first thing you have to check is it is a century year, if it is a century year you should check for divisibility by four hundred, if it is divisible by four hundred then you can say that’s a leap year. For example nineteen hundred it’s a century year so nineteen hundred and four hundred check the divisibility, nineteen hundred is not exactly divisible by four hundred hence nineteen hundred is not a leap year where as if you say two thousand it’s a century year so check for four hundred divisibility two thousand is exactly divisible by four hundred hence two thousand is a leap year, if it is not a leap year you should check divisibility by four so basically given a year the procedure is you need to check if it is a century year or not a century year. If it is a century year check for divisibility by four hundred otherwise check for divisibility by four if the divisibility is not satisfied say that it is not a leap year if it is satisfied say leap year. This is a procedure by which we get to know a year is a leap year or not. So this is about February and it is the number of days is determined if it is a leap year or not based on this factor this is determined so we have seen how to determine a leap year or not so the other months other than February what is the pattern? Somehow thirty days somehow thirty one days will see that alright other months we can divide into two halves so months till July if you would see the months January, march, may, July all these months have thirty one days they are odd numbered months January is one march is three may is five they have thirty one days, the other months February we have considered earlier so consider February here consider April june the other two months these months are even number April is number four june is month number six the month these months are even numbered months they have thirty days this is the pattern that is observed till july so from august there is a change in pattern. What is it? It’s simply a reversal what do I mean by that? That is this so from august the odd numbered months September November ninth month and eleventh month November have thirty days and the even numbered months from august, august is eight right so from august eight October ten and December twelve these months have thirty one days so this is the pattern from august so there is a change from august till july the pattern is reversed odd numbered months have thirty one days and even numbered months had as you could see here till july this is a pattern odd numbered months have thirty one days and even numbered months have thirty days. From august there is a reversal as you could see odd numbered months have thirty days and even numbered months have thirty one days. So based on these factors we should check if a given date is a valid date or not. So based on this factors we have to check it and use the library functions and display what is the date. What is a day what is the day of the week given a date that’s what we will be doing in the programming, we will see that in the next part.
FUN WITH CALENDAR: 07
Alright guys, so in the previous videos you had seen the different functionalities being provided by the libraries there are pre requisites then you saw the procedure by which we can calculate we can find the day of the week given a date so as I had said if we get an input from an user we need to be careful with something extra facts like there may be a typo or may be thing that is out of range basically that’s not an invalid thing may be enter you need to take care of all those things we had seen we had seen an algorithm as well sort of an algorithm the procedure we had seen so will go ahead and start coding will gets our hands dirty with coding so let’s start. So the first thing is something that is easier is you need to get year as you have seen in the documentation in our pre requisites videos python supports from the year nineteen seventy so user enters year before that so let’s get started with the coding let’s get started with the coding. Python supports from the year nineteen seventy right so the user enters the year before that you should say that please enter something from nineteen seventy some message like that and ask him to enter it so we will do that part first we need to get the input of that year so let me say year year is nothing but I need to get an input, input generally it would be in a string format that’s how python works so we need to type cast it to integer input I will have to say enter the year let me say nineteen seventy to the current year two thousand eighteen enter any year let me say that I will have to check he has entered something like this only if he has enter some other year before nineteen seventy that is something less than nineteen seventy he has entered we would say it is an invalid year so I will have a check here if year is less than nineteen seventy I should say print let me say have to say enter a year in the range nineteen seventy to the current year two thousand eighteen so I have to save this and again he have to give an input right so again I need to take it and this must keep going till he enters an valid year so I need to put this in a loop let me put while one I need this has to be continuously done but while one is continuous loop there is no wareness nothing but indication for true so as long it is true I am just giving the condition as true so it will pass the loop and it will keep running so when should I stop in case he has given so while one is nothing but an infinite loop as you could see that is it will keep asking for inputs and keep checking if it is an invalid input yes its fine you go ahead and asks for input again if it is valid input again you ask for input is it something fair right no right we should not do that so in that case we have to break we have to come out of the loop we have to quit. So that’s called break else that means the year is something from nineteen seventy that is nineteen seventy or above the value is something like that then you near out of the loop is what I mean. I hope you are understanding this part you get an input check if it is before year nineteen seventy in that case you ask him ask the user to enter again if not come out of the loop you do it inside an infinite loop and once then user enters an valid year to break to come out of the loop that’s how the working is. So this is for year and another thing is month a similar pattern will follow for month as well so let me just copy paste this block and I will do the modifications there, let me copy let me paste so here this is month, month enter month, month will take the value from one to twelve one to twelve right January is the first month and December is the twelth month it takes the value and now the checking ahs to be month is less than twelve and what if someone enters minus three is it a valid month? No right it has to be a positive value so you have to check for the positive value as well and month is greater
 
than zero greater than zero is positive and it should be its not less than twelve its less than equal to because the twelth month exit right so it should be less than equal to twelve. If that is the case it’s the valid input so I will remove this I will change it so if the month is within twelve it is a positive value and if it is within twelve then it’s a valid input so I break out of the loop else I will have to say print what shall I say enter a valid month from one to twelve so let me say that I will say enter a valid month from one to twelve. So that is how I got an input from month so I hope you are understanding this snippet its basically you are inputting month checking if it is within the bounce that is it should be a positive value or maximum allowed value is twelve, if it is within the bounce just say ok you are done getting the input otherwise you say that it is the invalid month you have to enter some valid value this is the range of the value and you continue asking for inputs so that why we are using an infinite loop. Once the input is a valid input you break out of the loop right, so this is how you have to get the input for month year month as well as date. For checking date you should check if it is a leap year or not also you should based on that you have to check what is the month that is being inputted and how many dates how many days are allowed in that month. So you should check that and you should get the input right, so for that first thing we have to do is we have to check for leap year. So let us define a function for it, leap let me say leap is nothing but check for leap year check for leap year. What is the input? The given year so I have to check for leap year then same like this I have to have to get the input for date basically so I have to get date let me say date enter the date and for date we don’t have a fixed range something like that so let me remove this part but still you should check if it is a valid date or not so let me say I will use a function here as well I will use a function check valid date so what are the factors that determines if it is a valid date or not? The entered value of date then the month the entered value of date the month and the year and the factor that it is a leap year or not. All these factors determine if it is a valid date or not, so based on that determine if it is a valid date if it is a valid date you break that is you done taking the inputs otherwise you have to say that you have to enter a valid date. Enter a valid date this has to be the message that has to be printed. I hope you are understanding the flow so let me just give you a very quick summary if what we have done till now. The first thing is we are taking year as an input python supports from nineteen seventy so if someone enters an year before that we will have to say that enter an year in this range will have to say that from nineteen seventy to two thousand eighteen the current year enter some year or maybe even if he enters some other ear its fine but ok let me say let me modify this message as well because you can enter anything after that. So let me say from nineteen seventy that’s a very nice message from nineteen seventy two is not because currently it is two thousand eighteen if you do it after five years you will have to change people will ask for some other so it’s all define anything before nineteen seventy is not defined from starting from nineteen seventy this is a nice message so anything before nineteen seventy is not defined after nineteen seventy that is from nineteen seventy and after that you can give any year as an input. So we are getting an input for a year then we are doing it for a month we are checking if it is within the bounce one to twelve and as well as we have to check we have to get the input for date and for getting the date and checking if it is a valid date we have various factors what is the entered date what is the month that has been entered previously what is the year that has been and if that year is a leap year or not, so first we have to check if it is a leap year then we have to use all these

factors to determine if the date is a valid date and once everything is valid you are ready to use this inputs into your built in library functions. So here as you could see these things, check leap, check valid date these are undefined functionalities. We have to define them will do that in the next part of the video.
FUN WITH CALENDAR: 08
Alright guys, in the previous video we have started off our coding we had define some functionalities we have just use the names check leap, check valid date will start defining them one by one. so will do with check leap functionality first so let me define it define check leap? It takes an year let me say it takes an year as an input now if it is an a century year you have to check the divisibility by four hundred otherwise you have to check the divisibility by four that is the procedure right so let’s check that first. Century year as I had said the last two digits are zeros so that is they are divisible by hundred that is the check we are doing. If the year is divisible by hundred year mod hundred is equal to zero that is the case then it is the century year and hence we have to check for divisibility by four hundred divisibility by four hundred if this is equal to zero that is it is divisible by four hundred then you just say return true, true that it is a leap year that is it’s a century year and it divisible by four hundred hence it is a leap year so you return true else that is the check for divisibility by four hundred fails in that cast it is not a leap year so you should return false aright and now this is the procedure if this is a century year. If it is not a century year so that comes under the else part if this particular condition divisibility by hundred fails what if they input is two thousand four it’s not divisible by hundred so this will fail so here we have to go ahead with checking for divisibility by four so will do that if year mod is equal to zero then you return true that is it is a leap year else if it is not divisible by four for example an input like two thousand seven would fall under this category return false that is not a leap year. So the logic is if it is century year you should check for divisibility by four hundred otherwise you should check for divisibility by four. So let us trace through some inputs. If it is thousand eight hundred that is eighteen hundred is the year at is pass to it so eighteen hundred mod zero is mod hundred is zero eighteen hundred is a century year so you check for divisibility by four hundred eighteen hundred mod four hundred is not equal to zero so its comes under else part and it is false that is eighteen hundred is not a leap year yes it is true. It works fine, what is the input is two thousand, two thousand mod hundred is zero yes ok its comes inside two thousand mod four hundred is zero yes it returns true it says two thousand is a leap year which is true. What if the input is two thousand sixteen? Two thousand sixteen mod hundred is not equal to zero so it comes into this else part it checks for divisibility by four two thousand sixteen mod four is equal to zero so it says true yes two thousand sixteen is a leap year is what it says which is true. If you are input is two thousand nine two thousand nine mod zero sorry two thousand nine mod hundred is not equal to zero so it comes into the else part it checks for divisibility by four two thousand nine mod four is not equal to zero so it comes into the else part and returns false. If says two thousand nine is not a leap year, yes it is true. So for all possible inputs this thing works fine so we have correctly coded the mechanism by which we can check if a given year is a leap year or not? So we are done with check leap see the warning symbol has vanished there is just one warning symbol for check valid date it involves this four factors so we will see that in the next part of the video.
FUN WITH CALENDAR: 09
Alright guys, so in the previous videos we had seen how to check if a given year if a given year is a leap year or not, we had seen how we can do that as you could see if that year is a century year you should check fir divisibility by four hundred else you should check for divisibility by four. So we have realise this leap year check right. So what is pending we have to check? If it is a valid date or not. So for checking for this, what are the parameters let us define let us we had already used the name so let us define it. So let us say define check valid date that was the name I had used so what are the parameters it had taken? It had taken the date it had then taken let us see it had taken date month year and the factor that it is a leap year or not a leap year, date, month, year and the factor that it is a leap year or not a leap year. Even here you can perform if leap year check is needed but given that we had perform we will directly pass in the factor that can be alternative way by which you can code it. So I am checking if it is a valid date I am beginning with my check so the thing is, first thing I have to check is the special month February it depends on it is a leap year or not. So I should say the first check is if this is a leap year the leap year factor that is this functionality has return true or false right this factor is true if the factor l which stands for leap year is true then I should first check if the month is February so I should check if the entered month is equal to two it stands for February that is the case you check what is the date that has been entered that is a leap enter and it is a February if it is less than thirty that is up to twenty nine is allowed right so I am saying if it is less than thirty you say you return true that is that is a leap year month is February and the date entered is less than thirty so its a valid date so you return true say that its a valid date. If this is not true else this is not a valid date so return false sorry false f has to be in caps for this we had done check for February month. Alright the first check that we have done now is for the month of February in case if it is a leap year, if the month is not February what is the case? So that comes here column number nine so the same column number nine see python indentation is important so here if I say else that is the input month is not February so what is the pattern? We had seen till july there was a pattern from august there is a change in pattern so then that we have to capture it. Let us first categorised that into month is before august or after august will categorised into if the month is before august or after august so august is the eight month right so let us see if month is less than eight if that is the case if that is a month before august that is till july till july what was the case odd numbered months had thirty one days even numbered months had thirty days so we will capture that we will check if that is a odd numbered month how will we check? Month mod two is equal to one if it is a odd number in that case you should check if the date must be maximum allowed is thirty one so let’s see date is less than thirty two so in that case we will say yes it is a valid date return true. Right see it is not the February month the special month its some other month only so we have to categorised at as before august of after august that is from august will have to categorised it so if it is before august if it is less than eight the month is less than eight august is the eight month if it is less than that it is before august check if it is an odd numbered month or even numbered month. If it is a odd numbered month maximum allowed date is thirty one so you say if date is less than thirty two it’s a valid date return that it’s a valid date else you return false stating that it is an invalid date so this is the pattern for odd numbered months thirty one days are there. If it is a even numbered month what
 
happens? This test will fail so here you should say else so this denoted the even numbered months in even numbered months the limit is thirty days so the same thing I will copy paste it I will use the same thing just that there are thirty days that is allowed so I have to change this limit as thirty one so if it is less than thirty one that is still thirty one will be allowed otherwise it will not be allowed this has to be there also here what if someone enters a negative value for month we had check the negative value so we check that as well so let me check it here check valid date is the check I am performing. So let me say date is greater than zero it has to be a positive value and this thing both the thing if it is satisfy you say it’s a valid date otherwise say it is a invalid date. That’s it the thing I had missed it in the previous video so I am including it please make a note of it. So ok will get back to this so what we had done till now? We check if it is a leap year, if it is a month of February then we allowed dates till twenty nine so we had set this if the date is less than thirty as the limit, in that case it is a valid date else it’s an invalid date. If it is not February we have two partitions of months if it is before august the odd numbers month have thirty one days, even numbered months have thirty days that we have capturing here. This is the pattern for before august so what if it is after august? So here I should give a else part then right so its column number thirteen so let me give an else part here column number thirteen else so this is the months the month is from august and above month is eight and above for this part same thing just that the pattern reverses for even numbered months you have thirty one days and odd numbered months have thirty days so let me copy paste it and let me make a very small modification with that it’s done if that is a even numbered months so this has to be zero so I hope you are understanding this part so given that you are in the eleventh week I assume that by now you are very familiar with this and you understand it fast that’s why I am going slightly fast but nevertheless if you feel that you need to slow down you can pause the video think over it you check the if else conditions you take an input run through the flow and you will understand it. Also this is not the only way by which we can write the code there may be many ways and when you have these many numbers of if else there are multiple ways we can viable the conditions. You try for alternate ways as well and discuss them on discussion form. So this all this checks we have done if it is leap year, if it is not a leap year the same things will hold but the only change is February will have twenty eight days, all the other months the thing is same right so let me just copy paste it let me copy let me copy till here copied ok so I should put that right so the leap year check I had done it in column five so let me go back and do it here in column five I will get back to column five ok so here I should give else and say I will paste ok so I had pasted it so the check is very similar that’s why I have copy pasted it but may be you can give a pause and you can thin over and you will understand the flow. May be one thing I will do is I will maximise this part I will explain ok this thing I have maximised see if you could see have saved it you could see this, the first check you are doing is if it is the leap year or not. If it a leap year and the month is February maximum allowed date is twenty nine so I had set this limit if all these are satisfied you say that it is a valid date else you say it’s a invalid date so you return false in case of valid you have to return true. If it is not February the partitioning is till July the add number months have thirty one days and even numbered months have thirty days. After july the pattern reverses that’s what we are capturing here if month is less than eight, eight is august right so if it is less than eight if it is before august this is a pattern if this is a odd numbered months you allow the maximum value

as thirty one else you say it’s an invalid date otherwise you allow the maximum value to be thirty that is if it is not a odd numbered month you allow it to be thirty this is till july. So after july the pattern is for the even numbered months allow up to thirty one for odd numbered months allow up to thirty this is the pattern. All this we have done if it is a leap year, leap year February has twenty nine days if it is a non leap year the only change is February has twenty eight days so I have to make a change here date is less than twenty nine till twenty eight is allowed. You say it’s true else you say its false and rest all things follows as such so maybe you can rewire this and write in another ways you can perform the February check at the later point of time as well you can rewire it in multiple ways given that there are so many branching you can rewire the conditions as you wish. Try different rewiring and do discuss in the discussion form its easy but you need to give some thought, you need to give some time here that’s it just pause the video here think over it take a pen and paper you run through the flow of this code just run through it try rewiring the conditions as I had said discuss them in the discussion form with all this it will be very clear it will be very crystal clear to you. So this is how we are checking if it is a valid date alright so we had seen how to check a valid date will see the remaining part after getting the input what are we supposed to do, Will see that in the next part.
FUN WITH CALENDAR: 10
Alright guys, in the previous videos you had seen how we can get the input and check if it is a valid input and then once the input is valid will proceed with how to check for the weak day that is the day of the week on which that day particular falls. So we had inputted the year anything from and after nineteen seventy is allowed and we had inputted the month and allowed range of values is from one to twelve and we had inputted the date. Valid date factor varies based on if it is a leap year the month the date, date month year based on all these factors your fact that the date is valid or not varies. We had seen how the variation is all these we had seen in the previous videos also I had explained in the slides as well that was we had coded from the slides you can try coding it in your own and you can see how the similarities and differences are between your approach and my approach exist and you can discuss all this in discussion form just that given that there are so many constrains it may appear that its very complex or something but nothing it’s just that my way of wiring the conditions is like this there can be multiple ways you try wiring by yourself you will understand that is very easy alright so by now you have got the input of by year month and date that is needed for our built in function that built in function is found in the library calendar so let me import that first. So that I can use it that is my ultimate purpose of this exercise, I will import calendar right so I had imported calendar so now I will be using it so this functionality week day presenting calendar is what will return as what is the day of the week given a date right? so we had seen how the signature of it we had seen how to use in a pre requisites videos will revisit it now so one thing that we have noticed it, it returns the index it says zero for Monday one for Tuesday and so on till six for Sunday this is how it returns your input it returns the output in this fashion. Zero for Monday to six for Sunday, zero for Monday, one for Tuesday, two for Wednesday and so on till six for Sunday This is how the calendar dot week day the week day functionality that is present in the calendar library works but that is difficult for humans to interpret so we need to convert that as well so first thing what we have to do is we have to get that index whatever it is returning so let me say day index day index is return by this thing calendar dot week day calendar dot week day of see the arguments of year comma month comma day, day is nothing but the date year comma month comma date ok so we had inputted it we had send the inputs for this functionality to work so it will work it will return an index which will say which day it is zero is for Monday one is for Tuesday so on till six is for Sunday but that is not easy for humans right so we will have to get the day from this day index so let me say day I have to get it from day index I will say get day I have to get day form day index day index right see there is a warning symbol which says that undefined that just said the name I haven’t defined what this has to do so let us define it. So let us just define here its fine define get day let me define it so what is the list of days let me say list of days the encoding is its starts from Monday zero is for Monday right so let me say Monday Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday this is the order in which encodes right Monday is encoded as zero, Tuesday is encoded as one and Wednesday is encoded as two and so on till Sunday is encoded as six. So I have created a list of days basically so I guess you would understand you could figure out what will be my next step, I will just return ok for this I need to have the day index right so day index I need to have the day index so I will just return the corresponding value from this list given by day index. List
 
of days of day index this is the most simplest definition I guess you are able to understand it the encoding is zero is for Monday one is for Tuesday and so on till six is for Sunday this I show the lists have their indexing mechanism so we are creating the list of days and whatever is the index that is being passed we will pass the corresponding element in that index as the output that is if the if the passed index is three then zero one two three its zero one two three its Thursday, Thursday will be taken as the output so we will get the name of the day here so that is obtained now we have to print the answer, let me print I will print a very good message I will say date this is how humans do it right by slash will separate it date month then we have another slash and year this is our human friendly format and I am printing in the human friendly format only I will say it falls on this particular day that is captured in the variable day so this falls on this particular day this is how the working is simple will just give a very quick summary and then will go ahead with running of this code see I am getting an input of year I am getting an year I am inputting year if it is after or from nineteen seventy I agree that input and I am inputting month that should be between the range one to twelve and I am inputting date and based on the factors if it is a leap year what is the month that is being enter? I determine if the entered date is a valid date or not then based on this I have I am inputting some date month year right so based on this things I am now passing it to the built in functionality calendar dot week day in calendar library you have the functionality week day we are passing this and it is returning a index it’s not retuning the name of the day its returning the index so for getting the name of the day I am using the list mechanism and I am getting day and after getting the day I am printing the this particular date month year falls on this day. This is how the working is so let me save it and let me run ok so it’s asking me to enter a year so let me say two thousand let me enter a month let me say four April let me enter a date let me say twenty five ok twenty five four two thousand falls on Tuesday I got an output. So like this you can check for any dates once your programs is ready running is see as you could see maximum it would have taken half a second that’s it its all the delay by which you are giving your input that’s it. If you hardcore the input if it is to be red from the code itself it will be really within in the fractions of seconds so this is really really very fast ok by which you can know the day of the week given a date alright guys so we had seen one task will see another task that we can do using these cool python libraries in the next part of the video.
FUN WITH CALENDAR: 11
Alright guys, so that was a very good exercise given a date you can quickly say on what day this particular date falls on so that is really very cool functionality that python provides and now we will see another task so this is the task if the current time is known as per your time zone can you say what is the time in other time zone? Based on different time zones I have to know the current time that is I can get the system time from the command as I had discussed in the pre requisite video for all the time zones can I get the name. So to get the current time as we had used the date time library we will be using that and to work with the time zones we will be using this library pytz tz for time zone py is for python pytz will be getting the current time and will display the time as per the different time zone as an output so that is what we will be doing in our task. Will see that in the next video.
FUN WITH CALENDAR: 12
Alright guys, so in this joy fun with calendars we had seen some cool tasks that can be done using some library provided by python we had seen them in the pre requisites also we had seen a task of given a date can you predict which day of the week that date falls on we have seen that so the next task we are going to see is you have to fetch the current time not only in the time zone that is followed in your current location but as per the time zones across the world that is what are all the time zones that is present I need to get that time as per all those time zones that’s what I want to do. So let me do that so as we had seen to get the current time we need to use the date time library so there is a super set as well as the sub set as I have discussed in the pre requisites video we just want to work with the sub set so let’s import it. From the super set date time library import the sub set date time library as dt because the name is lengthier so I am using a short name as dt so that this is to get the current time and you are going to work with time zones as well so let me import the library pytz py for python and tz for time zone so let me import this as well. So the first thing I have to do is I have to get the list of all the time zones. So let me call that as time zones time zones is nothing but it is given by this built in functionality in pytz library just say pytz dot all underscore time zones so if you just say that you will get the list of all time zones here so now simple just iterating through the list. We have the list of all time zones and we know given time zone we can fetch the current time as per the time zone so we are going to iterate through this list and then we are going to display the time corresponding to each time zone in this list. So let us just iterate it lets say for I in range length of this list the name of the list is time zones just iterate over this list so my current zones is nothing but at the ith element right so I am picking the current zone, I am iterating over the list I am picking the current element where I am standing I am picking the current position element so I have picked the current zone so now I should create a time zone instance time zone object a special object to work with time zones as we have seen in the pre requisite video we will be creating a special object so let me say tz time zone the convenient representation pytz the library name dot time zone is the functionality and what is the time zone that I need it is given by the variable zone this particular time zone is what I need so I have created an object and now I can print the current time easily right so I will print current time at zone what is a zone that is given by the variable zone is the current time how will we get it? From this date time library dt dot now is the functionality and to this functionality I have to pass this time zone object tz so I have passed it and so I got the time zone now right so that’s it just we can get the lists of all the time zones from this library pytz py for python and tz for time zone can get all the time zones and we are iterating over this list creating a time zone object special object by which you can work at that time zone irrespective of whatever is your current location a special time zone object we are be creating and we are passing the two functionality that fetch the current time so that it fetches the time as per that time zone and then we are printing the fetched time that’s what we are doing just simply iterating over the list. I hope from the pre requisites video if you are very clear and from the slides that I have discussed given the task it’s very easy you can easily connect the doubts and you can come up with this code this is really very easy see the code is just some eight lines probably another there are some spaces in between so some six seven lines of code that’s it that’s what we are using but what is the magic it’s
 
doing? You will understand if you get the output. So let me save this let me run this code see I am getting the output oh my god oh so fast it’s done see some five hundred plus time zones we have seen everything everything is outputted just in fraction of seconds that’s the magic so you can know the time at any place in fraction of seconds by using your python programming skills. Alright guys I hope you enjoyed this series on fun with calendars, thanks for watching. Have a nice day.
