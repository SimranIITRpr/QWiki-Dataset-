LISTS PART 1: INTRODUCTION
Hello guys, welcome to yet another programming screen cast, in this programming screen cast we will be teaching you a cool data structure that python provides you namely the lists don’t get don’t get terrified by the name data structures it is nothing but a way by which you can organise your data, you can arrange your data that is what you call as data structure basically. So list the name is even we use this particular thing list in our day to day life may be for when you have to for shopping you plan a list of items which you must definitely buy, off course we do buy items that we remember at that time when you go to a super market or based on the things that your neighbours in the super market buy off course there are changes in the list but I believe most of us have the habit of taking a smaller list of item that you must definitely buy that, that is they are at most necessities you have also that may be changes as I have said so the lists in the python also very much similar to that, so this is a flexible data structure naming that just now I have said you have a plan of your shopping item that you wants to purchase something but as need comes that may be changes in your purchases right? Something like that as and when there is a need you can add or delete items from the list. That’s just a flexible data structure, let us see more of it. So to introduce it I will start off with a sort of a recap that you had in your previous week lectures, so sir had introduced the concept of variables and how you can club variables with print statements I hope you remember that ok, let me give further more hint so that you remember really well. So we had used the different variables for example we had that, me be open a console alright the console is opened now ok so I hope you remember the example that sir has given. We are three TAs in this course t1 is the TA whose name is so double quotes we will use for a string that is for names we use double quotes amit is the first TA simran is the second pa and I am the third TA vidhya ok sir has used the variable I to denote the instructor sudarshan so this is the example sir has used to demonstrate the variables. So let me give you another situation, what if you need to store the details of the students who are taking up the course? So course students the strength may vary so we cannot say like this like here it’s fixed we know that for sure there three TAs so we have used these variables t1 t2 t3 so course students the strength may vary just as how I had given an example of shopping list you have a plan of buying some stuff but when you go to the super market you may buy something additional or you may feel that this particular thing is not really of much use to you or you may even some time you may plan something but you may get something better you may get a replacement there is definitely there are changes so something like that even here the strength of the students this is not something that is really well determined so what if it is determined? So for example let us consider a pg class room there may be some twenty students so in that case your solution would be s1 s2 s3 up to s20 maintain some twenty variable. Will be idea you will get as an extension of this concept as we already taught you but now a day’s things are changing it’s not just the class room teachings that happen every where or if you would see even our nptel course students strength keeps varying there more people may enrol in the beginning and as weeks go by some people drop out too or by all that what I mean is this is highly variable it’s never a case that there are twenty students and there will be twenty students till the end that is
 
never a case there may be additions or deletions so something like that even though is very much similar to our shopping list this is highly variable thing so to handle it we need something which is really flexible so for that we will use something called as a list. So let me write it, it’s called a list. I hope it is visible to you guys ok? So I have increased the font size list, so that we call structure as list which is a flexible data structure where you can add and delete items really easily that is what you call as a list, so let me let us go ahead with our shopping example or the student example anything as you wish. I hope shopping example is more connected to us because most of us will have the habit of maintain a list of things that you need to definitely buy so let me take that as an example itself so let me say shopping that is the name of my list so these are the things I need to buy so, I wanted to have a list so this is how you create a list please note this, please note this you are using this type of brackets square brackets we call them as we are using this kind of brackets in your keyboard this is near to your alphabet p this key, please see this, this brackets we use to denote list, his is how we are creating a list. So if I say shopping and just the brackets and empty list by name shopping is created. So that is the list is available but now items are presented in the list so that is what is happen happening if you just save this. If you want to insert item say for example I want to buy bread, coffee, sugar these are something I definitely want to buy so this is my shopping list as of now ok so if I say enter the list is created, if I just say a name equal to an you think the square brackets within that I enter the items separated by commas this is the syntax by which you create the list ok? so if I want to know what are in my shopping list I will say as usual this is how you had this for this variables print t1 say amit print t2 gave simran print t3 gave vidhya and so on just as how you had it print command can be used here as well print shopping if I say print shopping see I am getting the list here, bread, coffee, sugar but see I don’t wanted with this quotes and that square brackets, commas I don’t want it in the some tactical format, I want to write in a format that is friendly for us, how will we write down the shopping list one by one, one below the other right? so I want to print it in that fashion, how will I do that? Simple, will use what we had studied in the previous week our friend loops mainly for loop will be more friendly here, can also try using the other loops I leave it as an exercise you try using the other loops most of the task which can be done by for loop can be run by while loop as well something like that so you just try using while loop as well I will demonstrate using a for loop. So the method is, for the, let me just recap the for loop how we had used it for numbers. For I in range three what does this do? It will count zero one two, if I say this and a colon see the next line appears indented. I will say print I ok, let me say enter see I got zero one two so to deal with numbers you had used a functionality called range dealing with the items of a list is really very simple so let me demonstrate how that is done for item I or item anything for item in the name of the list you have to give here, what is the name of the list? Shopping. Shopping is the name of our list; I will give shopping for item in shopping print item ok. See bread coffee sugar it has displayed the item just one below the other just as how we would write it in a piece of paper, see observe it is very much similar to what you have leant in your previous weeks in fact much easier than that as well for numbers you are using this functionality of range for list it is very simple just use the name of the list for item in shopping this is the intuit name I have given actually you can give any name here this and this you can give any name but this two has to be same you can give any name item is intuit even that it is a shopping bag shopping basket

trolley sort of thing given that so things inside it called as items so I had used the name item so this is how you print the items of the list in this fashion one by one alright, this process of checking through each item in the list and printing so let me print the list as such for your understanding once again if I say print shopping just as how I already set print t1 print t2 just we had said like that something like that if I say print shopping it prints in this manner with the square brackets and quotes something that is computer friendly format not a human friendly format to make into human friendly format we are using loops. See what this loop does here for item in shopping, it get into the list called shopping and checks over each of the item, each of the entity present here and it will print that entity the first iteration this is called item is assign the value bread so bread is printed here in the next step coffee is coffee is assign to the variable item so coffee is printed in the next step sugar is assign to the variable item so sugar is printed so this process is called the iteration this is nothing but your iterating over the list that is you are checking through each item that is present in the list, you are checking through each Element that is present in the list so this is how you iterate over the list that is you would check through each and every element in the list. Ok so I have printed all the element in the list what if I want to add another element? I want to add another element let say I would say curd, let me say curd so I should use a functionality there is a functionality available for this it is called as append it is an English word only append is nothing but adding to the end so append functionality would add it to the end of the list so if want to add another item say for example curd I would do it by shopping. Append of this is a bracket so inside the bracket give my item is curd, I want to buy curd as well so I have appended it to the shopping list so we shall try this print shopping we will see what is in the cart? Now see initially we had this as our shopping cart that is shopping list bread coffee sugar due to this command appending another item curd your shopping list has become like this bread, coffee, sugar as before and curd is added to the end of the shopping list ok, this is how I had added an item so, is this the only way by which we can add an item it is only possible that you can keep adding at the end what if you want to change the priorities
LISTS PART 2: MANIPULATION
What if you wanted to buy something say oil, you wanted to buy oil, definitely oil is not even a single drop of oil is there in your house and you need to buy oil for sure even if coffee is not available sugar is not available you are ok with it but you definitely want oil so you want oil to be pushed to the first part of the list so how would you do that? There is a method available for that as well that is called as insert method that is you insert at the given position, you can specify at position you need to insert the item so let me say bread is needed for me then I want oil so and please note that an indexing starts from here this is what called as indexing so I will demonstrate that first then let us go into this thing of inserting the items at some specific positions ok so if I would say shopping of one this is what you called as an index at this list shopping at index one what is the element present? So index is something like a position holder something like this so by saying one what do you expect do you expect bread would be printed? Right? Let us see what happens, see coffee is taken that is the second item I had asked one its printing second item instead of the first item so let me try zero, shopping of zero let me try see it is now showing the first item so what do you understand from this? Computers count in a different way exactly computers count in a different way the counting starts from zero, human start counting from one we will say one two three four, four items are present the computers will count it as zero one two three. What is the third item? If we ask the human he will say one two three third item sugar, but computer will say zero, one, two, three, third item curd so, I guess you understand the difference between the computers counting and the humans counting it differs by one so if you need the second item you should say two minus one, at the index one so indexing, so this is what you call as indexing, index is nothing like a position holder so this is position zero, position one, position two position three according to the computer so this is how the individual elements can be accessed, individual element can be accessed using indexes indices index using that you can access this elements ok so is there we had printed it using some way already using the for loop so using this indexing mechanism can be printed using our range function which we are used in numbers where is that is another way of printing the elements of a list slightly around about way compare to the simpler way we had done earlier but this is a recap for your range functionality of previous weeks as well so let us see this way of printing each element in the list let us see it for I in range how many elements are there in our list one two there four for computer it is zero one two three range functionality starts counting from zero we want to count till three so what should be the number given inside it should be four because this particular number is when it reach four it will stop counting so it will not consider four so till three only it will consider, that what we too wanted so we will set for I in range four print I will say shopping of I please observe the square bracket are being used here shopping of I ok, see same thing bread coffee sugar and curd this is printed so this is slightly roundabout way simpler way is for item in sorry I have to give the space here it’s very there is a change in colour which is not visible for item in the list name is shopping, shopping print item see we got the same thing so this are two different ways by which you can print the items of the list one after the other just like how we write in a piece of paper, for one we just by using a
 
variable inside a list other was using the indices index so when will the index will be highly useful is if you want to extract only just few elements in that case indexes will be highly useful for example I had given you another instance like students information eight in the beginning I have given you an example of students information in that case let us assume that every student has role number or id number whatever you can say so they have arranged in that order based on their id number data has been arranged and stored so in that case if you want to extract the details, if you want to extract the name of the student whose id number is twenty you can use these thing like students of twenty so in our we have four items I want to extract the second item so for second I should say I should say two minus one so index is one shopping of one this extracts the second item so in our in that case I felt student of id minus one or id in case if you start counting if you say in zero position you have something like that name let us say heading name has been that’s how we generally write so let me say name then you start writing student one student two and so on so this is generally write right? So let us assume in this way only our list has stored items so at zero index we will have this thing name which sort of a header so s1 student whose id number is one will be at index one, student at id number two will be at index two this is one way by which you can manage the difference between a computer and a human spouting. Just an idea I have given you can try implementing this student information list in any way as you wish so in that cases when you want this particular specific caleman to be accessed in that case the indexing will come highly handy let me say as I now given that I have said about indexing, I will come back to the thing that, I had said already inserting your items at random position that is at a given specified position see for example, I remember that I need oil definitely bread definitely I need next priority is for me is oil coffee may go in a lower priority that is even as coffee is not available I will not be that sad but oil is definitely needed something like that let us assume this is the scenario so, I want bread oil coffee sugar curd in this order I want my list to be so append as I had shown you already if you would see I had used terminology, I have used append so, I have used the up arrows as we have said already up arrow is used for history look up in case you want to go down you can use the down arrows as well up arrow is for going to the precious command if you want to move one down just assume that it is like a history look up is nothing but like a ladder you can climb up and down the ladder to see what you have done in the past ok so I had appended one item let me say I wanted shampoo, I append shampoo so, I have appended it because of it I want to print the shopping item let me print it see shampoo got added at the end so is this the only way by which we can do, can we change the ordering I want it as bread oil coffee and so on I wanted to be like this so how will I insert it for that we have a command called insert let us see it, what this command specifically does this? If you give position and say insert the item it will insert the item into that position so it will shift the other items automatically see how flexible it is, if you are if you had realised something if you are using a variables like i1 i2 i3 for different items and if you want to change the priority just assume how much of work you have to do, i1 i2 you had made coffee and you wanted i2 to be oil and i3 to be coffee if you make i3 equals to coffee then sugar value will be lost so you have to move it to the next next next so how much of shifting you have to do man all this is neatly handed by python data structure mainly the list. So let us see inserting the specified position let me insert shopping. Insert is the functionality insert you need to give the see some help was given index and object is says so its nothing

but object is nothing but a position as I said so position and whole depth not position exactly as per humans position that is one less you need to give and then the object whatever you want to insert into your list object is the general terminology python users items object items anything you can say so this is the method by which you do you have to give the position first so I wanted it to be the second position as per humans so it must be index two minus one that is one, one I need to insert item I say oil I want to insert oil in this basket so I had given it, it could have got inserted and let us check that as well so see it got inserted correct oil coffee sugar curd shampoo so this as per my priorities see how handy python lists are there is much more functionalities that are available in this let us see them as and when the need comes also we will give you a hint on whole things that we may be using frequently and as and when the need comes you can check out our video we will explain also you can check out the python documentation there are a lot of functionalities available in this list let us see something which may use frequently so this list specifically has stink items see bread oil coffee all this are distinct items but sometimes some lists may have repetitions’ for example consider census data something like that you have list of all ages of people living in a city something like that so there will be definitely repetitions right? you cannot say that if a person is thirty years old is living in the city no other person of thirty years old should live in that city definitely there will be repetitions so in that case you may be interested in finding how many number of people of specified age group is present in that city for that we have a functionality called count let us create that data set from random data set we say ages if the name of our list let me just say twelve, twenty three, thirty four, forty two, fifteen, eighty seven, twelve, sixteen, twenty five, twenty three, eighty two, fifty seven, seven, three, two, three, one, twenty ok. just assume that this is the list of ages of different people so we had created a list we have a data so in this definitely there are few repetitions as you could see twelve, twelve here somewhere else could also be same so in that case I want to see how many people of age twenty five live in this city? So how will I do that? I have a functionality called count that is been provided by python lists it is use that ages is the name of the list dot count is the function inside it you need to give what is the value? What is the object? What is the item for which you want to see, I said the age is twenty five this what I want to check so I will say twenty five see it says one so basically in this list just one time the number twenty five occurs that is one person of age twenty five is there in our list. If I say ages of count of twelve let me say see it shows two because we have twelve here as well as here see we have twice what if we given age which is not present in our list for example let me say seventy I don’t think there is a seventy year old person in this list, see it says zero so it will return zero which is the element which you want to check in the list, if you use this functionality it will take this element check prove then this how many number of times this element is present in the list and it will return that answer, if it is not present it will return zero see how neat it is this functionality will be useful in one of our upcoming exercises that is why I have taken the data set where there will be repetitions see how many elements are there in this list? I want to know this. Can you manually count it? One two three four five six oh I am getting very tired shhh its seems too long it’s looking like Nile river something like that I don’t feel like I want to count it is there a way I can ask python to count and tell me, off course yes! There is the way that’s why you could see my tone was not very sorrow full something like that I am joyful because there is a way by which I can count how many number of items are there in

this list? This list is very handy especially in case when we have a lot of data items for example let us say the student data I said list of students in our online course see there are thousands and thousands of students so manually counting over each name and then saying that these many students are present is really difficult checking in our shopping list I have created a really small shopping list just with five items so it was easier to count but see even ages data the sample just I said just it is a city but this is would probably be in a street, this data could probably belong to a street only. If you take a people of all ages in a city it will be really much longer than this even this we cannot manage manually though real world data may be grow really really big in that case we have to make use of some functionalities of python to make our life simpler so once such functionality helps us find the length of the that is what it called as length the terminology uses length that is how many number of elements are present in this list? We can check that the way is you have to say Len that is the functionality length of the name of the list see ages it says eighteen there are eighteen elements in this items and let us just if you are sort of is it really a eighteen I need to count it, let us test with the something that we know shopping list, shopping list has five items as I have said six oh! Did I had another yeah I added oil yeah fine there are six items see it counts properly even I made a mistakes humans can make a mistake but computer will not make mistakes so this is the functionality that come handy in many situations so please make a note of it this is how you find the length of the lists so in that way where we can use the range functionality and indexing facility and print the elements in a list for example let us see ok so I will look up the history see that time I had just four items in my list, I had just four items in my list ok, see it is printing just four, now I say print shopping, if I just change it here I will not look up further print shopping if I would say print shopping see there are more than five items so if you manually want to give an number it is difficult so in this case you ant python to intelligently alter the number as and when your list grows or shrinks so let us use the length function here so length of shopping, shopping I need to close it ok, see now you got all the items so what it does? It will find the length and it will iterate that many number of times so it will go that many number of steps so this is the list the length is six so it will go and take this element, this element this element and every element will be covered so by using this length functionality and loops you can iterate ever each item in the list this is one way further simpler way is as I said is for item in shopping this is really a simpler way because you may not even think about the range, length and all these things so for each item in shopping as long as there are items in this list keep printing just as how you give the instruction in English with some modification you can do it in python really an easy way ok.
LISTS PART 3: OPERATIONS
Alright guys, we have list of ages of different people see there are some ages we have had checked using the count functionality let us check once again probably. Ages.count of twelve see it returns two whereas ages.count of seventy it returns zero where as some other values say ‘twenty five’ it returns one twenty three, it returning two see look at the let us print the ages so that we can refer it again print ages see these are the values I cannot verify it manually I am believing but still if I want to verify its taking me some time to check whether the answer written is right or not? Also I couldn’t get an idea of what is the age group of people there living in that city something like that say for example this area has a lot of youth population or this area has a lot of senior citizens something like that some kind of inference I couldn’t male out from this data do you think is there some way if I modify this list you can infer something? Just give it a thought. Yes one simple way, if you would thing out is if the data is sorted that is it is arranged in ascending order or descending order something like that if it is sorted we can get an idea what is an minimum value what is the maximum value or may be examine the mid position to get the average of it something like that you can get some analyses you can give some more idea than having the idea like this if it is sorted that is if it is arranged in some ascending or descending order you can get some more idea so let us see how can we sort it, there are some sorting algorithms you would have heard of techniques like bubble sort quick sort merge sort don’t worry if you haven’t heard of it nothing its nothing never not a problem it’s not a rocket science don’t worry if you haven’t heard of it you can definitely learn it in fact will be pitching some sorting technique in our course as well also python has a functionality which lets you sort the numbers even if you don’t know any of the sorting techniques just say sort it will sort the numbers for you so let us see how sorting can be done. Ages.sort this is the way you will get the sorted list see ages could have been sorted now I want to print the sorted functionality so let me say print ages I obviously use the history look ups using the up arrow ok, see now the ages has been sorted now you can verify count of twenty three was two yeah there are two values twenty three I the previous list since it was distributed some way I couldn’t really check if it is correct or not something like that just not for checking but we can make many analyses the least is one year old kid to the eldest person in the city is eighty seven year old person so here just two senior citizens and till thirty five it can generally consider as youth so yeah more youth is there in this particular factious city that we have considered probably because am an youngster who is typing in the ages I have list of age that is young it all depends so you can make some analyses right? That’s what is the point. Sorting by sorting you can get some analysis will be easier so sorting is one such technique that will make most of your things handy it will make most of your things simple your complicated life would be made simplified with the sorting technique so this I the way how you can sort it in case you want to reverse it what is the method? That is sorted in the reverse sorted fashion sort will generally do it in the ascending order so if you want the descending order ascending order is nothing but the elements if you would see one less than two less than three that is if you go in this way from left you will see the numbers in increasing order like see if you have seven here something less than seven definitely lie to the
 
left of it, it will never come in the right of it. If the numbers are arranged in that way if you take any number all numbers less than that will be in the left side and all greater than that will be on the right side if the numbers are arranged in this fashion then you call numbers then you call numbers are arranged in ascending order and if you want the numbers to be arranged in descending order what is the way? Just think for some time you will get the idea. I hope you got the idea, nothing? Just if you would print this thing in the reverse order it is descending order, descending order is nothing but as I had said you would scan from the left numbers will go in the decreasing trend so eighty seven if I say in the reverse order eighty seven, eighty two fifty seven forty two see if at this point forty two the numbers they are before it that is if you would read it from the left to right just assume that it is left to right in that case you will get the numbers on the left will be greater than it and the numbers from the right will be less than it this is true for all numbers in that sequence this is what we call as a sequence mathematically, in nothing but a list in that list if all numbers are like this then you called as the list is sorted in descending order descending is decreasing order, ascending is increasing order, ascend and descend they say right? For mountain if you are climbing up the mountain they call it as ascend and climbing down the mountain is called the descend right? so that’s how the names comes ascending order and the descending order so let us see how can we make it descending order like I had said reversing the list that is by reading in the reverse order you are getting it so can w reverse the list? Yes! We can there is a functionality called reverse let us see there ages,reverse reverse ok it got reverse so let us print it now see as I has said it is in the reverse order eighty seven eighty two fifty seven and so on it is in the reverse order it is now in the descending order so by reversing again back you will get the ascending order so you alternately keep reversing you will get ascending and descending order once you apply sort you will get the ascending order and if you keep reversing you will travel between ascending and descending order ok this ordering of numbers comes handy in many situations and please note this method by which you use built in python functionality to perform this sorting operations that is ordering arranging in a particular order that is what we call as sorting technically sorting operation fine, so let us see some other powerful technique using lists for that let me consider some other data set the student data set that I had said you, let us have some data ok students data set let me just have some fractious data students equal to some names let me say let use doubles quotes let say arun I will say ‘rajesh’ I will say for example ‘Harish’ some three girls akanksha, lakshmi, varsha some names I have taken some lists of students are they first sorted? I don’t think so I had just randomly entered the names see why do I sort them? Because that’s how generally we store right in academic records in an alphabetical order they will be arranged and that is called the attendance order so let me sort them we have just now learnt how to sort apply that technique and then sort so they would have been sorted so let us print students yeah they have been sorted akanksha Harish lakshmI rajesh varsha so these are the students we have in a class just assume that so in that let us assign the role numbers to them let us say as I had said you can have it as zero generally our role numbers will start from one but computers starts from zero to counter that you can either make changes in your programme as you write code in the future or you can intelligently insert some mean values in the zeroth position that is first value that you see is index zero at zeroth index insert some dummy value then you can manage this as one two three so let us do the this way of managing this as one two three by inserting a dummy value

in the zeroth position let me say let us insert the course name for example so let me say how would I insert at specific position we had seen using the insert function right? So let me say students. insert at the position zero, zero is the first position see the computers perspective and the humans perspective differ by one so you for first position for humans and zeroth for computer so at zeroth position let me insert the course name for example joc this is our course name I have inserted it tight? Now let me print see I have an inserted it double variable right and now I wanted to extracted a subset of students what do I mean by that? Three are some six students in my data set in my class basically data set is nothing but in my data six students I have considered some six random names I have considered there are some six students I want to extract a subset that is the few of them only I don’t want to considered every one of them so how would I do that? This is the special operation called slicing let me write that for you slicing.
LISTS PART 4: SLICING
See this is also an English terminology you are cutting the slice of it we say right in English something like that from this whole list slice of bread can say from whole bread pack you take some slices of bread something like that you assume this your whole bread packet a list are separate a packet you want few slices of the bread something like that you assume so this is the terminology we call as slicing. So slicing let us see how can that be done so that general syntax how you can slice a list is as follows list name and within the square brackets you have to give start till end plus one please note this syntax especially this end plus one so whatever the number you give same like your range function it will count one less the end point will be counted one less so if you say from role number one to three I want, you should say one to four so that it counts the third person something like that so this is how you should do slicing operations as I said I want one numbers one to four let me say for that what should I say? Students starting position is one here we have to give the index please not that start index this is the sorry here should I be giving the I did again starting index to end index so see this is start index and end index this is computers perspective you should give the numbers in the computers perspective here to manage the human and computers perspective differences I have inserted this dummy value at the zeroth index this is one way by which you can manage or its better I that recommended you guys used to the computers perspective and code it in this way only and upcoming exercises will also be in that way only we will make you familiar with the computers perspective don’t worry if you don’t feel the comfortable at this stage, definitely you will get comfortable as you keep practicing. The key thing here is practice just keep practicing you will find everything is easy for you. Fine ok so I want the role numbers from one to four right? So how would I do that? From one to four is what I wanted and please note here it is end index plus one because same like your range function this functionality the slicing functionality also would count one less than the specified end point so you want to count till four then you should specify it as five see let us see, see this is written one two three four akanksha arun Harish lakshmi this is extracted so we have extract of the slice and please note that it is not necessary that you have to give both these indices the start and end that is optional if I say students and if I just give colon what happens? See entire thing is taken so what does this mean? The default value they have some default values it means if you haven’t specified something what should the computer do? That has also been defined in python. For the default value for the start is the actual starting index that is zero the default end value is the total length minus one see because there are seven elements in the list so it will be zero one two three four five six so seven minus one, length minus one is the default end value zero is the default start value, if you dint give anything if this is also one way by which you can extract out the entire list. This is slightly roundabout but this would actually give you the entire list this is yet another by which you can get the entire list and if you just give the starting value and you let end value as such what happens, let us see, see I am giving the third person and I left the end value blank what happens? See from index three the third person Harish till the end it has taken so whenever you don’t give a value it will look up to the default value and use it so here you haven’t given end so it took the default end
 
value of the length minus one and it has taken so basically in English this translates to start from the third person and go till end this is English translation of this slicing statement. Ok what if you don’t give the start value? Simple it will take the same default value zero let us see that too ok am not giving the start value I will say up to five so up to index five it has to stop that means the four persons it will take see it has taken from the beginning, it has stopped before the index five see zero one two three four at lakshmi it has stopped see the end value is always when it reach five it will skip it, it will not consider five so till four it has considered. So I guess you understand the slicing mechanism that is to extract out the subset of a list we use this slicing the start value and the end value, end value please note that you have to give one extra because same like your range function it would stop counting when it reaches this particular given end value, given end value here is five so when it reach index five so it stop counting, it had quit it had counted only up to four so you have to make sure that you give the indices such that extract out the parts that you need. Any if you don’t give start value the default start value is zero if you don’t give end value default end value is, I am sorry I had said that has length minus one it is length see because we are giving one access right? Till length minus one you wanted to move means you have to give length as the answer. The default end value is let me write it as commands here default start sorry that is a start index is zero and the default end index is nothing but the length of the list I will highlight this statement default start index is zero the default end index is the length of the list these values will be taken only when the user has not specified the value that is see here start is specified, end is not specified so in that case this start value will be taken and since end is not specified it will look up to the default end value and take that value here end is specified start is not specified so it will take up the default start value only when you don’t give any value it will take the default value, if you have given some value it will take the values you have given ok. so let us see one more thing students of two to five so it has taken indices two three and four it has just printed that so when you have given the values it will take the values that you gave if you haven’t given the values it will take the default values that is what the concept of default values. If you have some experience of c programming something like that you have something called default lock switch case default locks have you heard something you can relate to it, it is very similar to that even if you have haven’t heard please don’t worry, the concept is if the user has provided something that has to be taken, if nothing is provided take this particular standard value default can be transferred into standard value, so these are the standard values that has been defined this will be taken. Alright I hope you have seen the difference operation in list these are not only operation that can be done list, there are a lot of them you can refer to the documentation online, I would recommended you guys please try with different kinds of list, different things with numbers names with the floating point values for that you can take the stats calculation for example because if it is fourteen percent tax then when you multiply by zero point one four you will get some decimal values the floating values we call that in computer science you can get that as well so I would like you guys try different data type list with this we cal as data type that is the data is of type integer or a floating value is nothing but the decimal point is there so real numbers something like that you, it’s a string or a word something like that you try a different type of data’s, different type of list, different type of operation and only by practice you can realise that lists

are really flexible and they come handy keep practising thanks for watching the video happy learning.
LOOPS AND CONDITIONALS: FIZZBUZZ 01
Hey hey amith, come we will play a game know I will teach everything come ok ok, shubudha and suma come let’s play a game come come cheer up come. Ok see the game is called as fiizzbuzz ok, we are six in numbers so the game goes like this, he will start from one and then two and for all multiples of three will tell fizz and then multiples of five will tell buzz and multiples of three and five will be fizzbuzz! Yes. So you got it. Play? Ok ok. Should I start? Yeah. One two fizz four buzz fizz seven eight fizz buzz eleven fizz thirteen fourteen fizzbuzz. Hey this is so easy know so is it? Ok then, we will check from one not one, you start from one not one. One zero one fizz one not three, one not four, buzz, one not six, one not seven, fizz, hey hey!! That is fizzbuzz yesss! Actually now it’s getting complicated. Correct! Yeah so complicated, hey this is a nice game I think I should write a piece of code for this; it will be a kick back for me. Why do you think of coding all the time? Go get a life dude, exactly! Hey this is what I enjoy, will definitely write a code for it. Hello, every one today I am here to code for fizzbuzz we saw you guys saw me playing that game and I told that day that I am going to code for it so let’s see how we can code write a programme for fizzbuzz. So first I will start my spyder, so assuming that you have all installed anaconda on your system, I am using my Mac you need to start your spyder so go to your terminal and type spyder in even though it is same in windows you can go to start and write spyder in your application and you will get a spyder idle and just click on it and the spyder will open so let’s see, so you need to install anaconda first, with anaconda you get spyder idle, without spyder also you can work on your simple terminal or command prompt but we strongly recommend you to use spyder because it is very easy for you guys. So I am already created a file name here fizzbuzz here, if you will just start a spyder you will get a new file here you can save it by name you want so I saved it as fizz buzz now here I will write all my programme for fizzbuzz. Okay guys let’s do this. So this is the place where I write my programme, this is the place where all the outputs and console related things will come so I hope you guys know the interface well anyways you can always Google up and look what are the things here so this is the new Ipython console which starts with the spyder in the Ipython means instructive python so you can visualise things here will see in some other examples in how we can use the Ipython so here the grid thick python is that you can even do the computation on fly, fly means in console you can write things and it will give the output so for example, if I write two plus three, it will just show me ‘five’ so, it’s better you like that if you does the computation on flier that then in c, c++ where you have to create an dot exe file and you can run it on your computer which will show you the output here interactive Ipython console are works like this do the computation on fly. So what the fizzbuzz let me explain the fizzbuzz game again so what we did there suppose a person is saying the number and that number is multiple of three then that person has to say fizz rather than saying that number at loud so suppose if I am saying one two and three comes then I have to say fizz or any multiple of three comes like if six comes then also I have to say fizz or nine comes then also I have to say fizz and if the multiple of five comes then I have to say buzz if ten comes I have to say buzz and if multiples of three and five comes for example the number which is divisible by three
 
and five I have to say fizz buzz for example if fifteen comes I have to say fizz buzz rather than just saying fifteen and a person if says rather than saying all these three, if he says the number then he is out of the game so what we are going to programme, if a number comes which is the multiple of three I have to say fizz if it is a multiple of five I have to say buzz if it is a multiple of both of three and five I have to say fizz buzz for that I need a loop so what I will do I will just print a number from one to fifty and check whether my loops work and then I will just divide that number with all my taking care of all the condition I will write those condition and I will complete my programme for that first I need a loop. Loop the syntax of I assume you know the syntax of loop is very simple and straight for I in range, range is the pre defined function in python where it takes the number and prints the range from zero to that number, even negative values it can take but I am taking positive value so suppose if I type in a range fifty then just print the number, it will gives the value from zero to forty nine so it starts from zero ok zero to forty nine we will get but what I want is print numbers from one to fifty for that I will write for I in range one to fifty one because it is giving always the number minus one values I will write print I that’s it we will get numbers from one to fifty ok great now I know how to write a loop so I will just write that loop here I will write for I in range one to fifty one ok now I have a number at every iteration of this loop I will get a number from one to fifty one suppose if I get a number which is the multiple of three I have to print fizz rather than that number once I will write there print if condition, for that I need if condition I have to check whether the number is divisible by three or not if it is divisible by three then I have to print fizz I will write if I mod three is equal to zero which means I is divisible by three print fizz that’s it and if it is divisible by five for example the number ten it is divisible by five then I have to print buzz but that I will write if else I mean if it is not divisible by three but it is divisible by five else if I mod five is equal to zero which means if it is not divisible by three but it is divisible by five print buzz and if it is divisible by both three and five then I have to write fizz buzz for that I have to write a condition if I mod three is equal to zero and because I need both the condition that is I mod five is equal to zero so if I mod three is equal to zero and I mod five is equal to zero it means then the number is divisible by both three and five and then I have to print, print fizzbuzz that’s it we are done so let me click the console here I will just run this programme you can run it from here you can see that hi am getting fizz buzz fizz buzz fizz buzz fizz fizz something like that I don’t know which number is giving me fizz which number is giving me buzz and which is giving me fizz buzz for that I need to print that number also so I will write the number, I will associate the number with their corresponding fizz then in order to print two string plus operation for example if I want to concatenate see here amit sudarshan with plus operator I can concatenate these two string it will show me amitsudarshan, hence I want to print I associated with that number means it will show if three is coming it will show three is equal to fizz, it will show like this three is equal to fizz so it will show like this three is equal to fizz for that what I will do in the print statement I will first convert the number, number is integer so I have to convert that number in to a string ok for that I will write str of I for convert my I whatever I am getting here fifty one into a string with plus operator I will concatenating this string with the fizz, if it is fizz right? I will copy this and if it is none of this neither fizz nor buzz nor fizz buzz then I have to write else just print you can just print I also head start I will show you what string does for example I file a number x is equal to one two three four if I write str of x

it will give me a string and it can always be you can save this also and you know this sting is character only so if you write a two get the value at two array is always starts with zero it should show me two ok let’s get back to the programme everything is complete now I will just run it and let’s see what happens great it’s running everything is fine for one I don’t have anything for two nothing three should print fizz ok I am getting fizz I will give a space here should look nice, better whatever you programme it should look nice ok we will run it again yeah perfect for one I am getting nothing, for two nothing, three is fizz, four is nothing, five is buzz, six is fizz, because it is a multiple of three nine is multiple of three fizz, ten is multiple of five buzz twelve is multiple of three thirteen fourteen nothing, fifteen is fizz ok see this fifteen I am getting fizz but I suppose to get fizz buzz because fifteen is multiple of both three and five so, here is the problem this is the very common problem we get according to me and according to you guys also I suppose that this programme is very the logic is very perfect I don’t think there is any flaws in the logic but still I am getting fizz here rather than fizz buzz I am not getting fizz buzz so what’s the problem? So can you guys guess? What did I do wrong, in next video I will explain what is the problem and we will see how to correct it and how to write a right programme for this fizzbuzz? You can post all your problems regarding this video in discussion form you can also discuss there so I encourage you guys to discuss this problem on discussion form will see this in next video.
LOOPS AND CONDITIONALS: FIZZBUZZ 02
Hey amith! Yes sir. You have some time? Sure sir. Please sit, I stopped you because you look a little worried and you looked a little engrossed in some thought. That’s what are you thinking? Yes sir exactly. So I was ready to write a code for a puzzle game I don’t know whether you have heard about it or heard of it or not, its very famous puzzle I know not very difficult one but when you try to write a code of it then you get stuck somewhere correct, and it’s not only me I tried to Google it and I found that many actually more than eighty percent of the people get stuck there and its very surprising that how it is happening? And why we all of them are getting stuck at that point only? Correct. So you are discourage thinking that probably your programming skills are poor, exactly yeah. Because of which so have you become programming all this while? Yeah yeah I think I am a good programmer. But this particular thing as a bouncer coming that’s what you are saying, yeah ok so I also personally feel that fizzbuzz is slightly hyped on the internet, so historically speaking there is some story behind fizz buzz I am sure you know of it if not I will just brief you with it. It is believe that a whole lot of programmer so who claimed that who are good programmers cannot even write a simple code ok? Ok the simple code in codes a good candidate example for a simple codes is this fizzbuzz as you know you describe it right? It’s some multiple of three and five that you want to display in a particular way and like that right? Exactly. Let me illustrate what exactly is the problem. Do u know of any tongue twister? Yeah when I was kid I use to know some. Can you tell me some tongue twister of your choice? My friend once told me so I will try. Bity bought some butter, but the butter was better so he bought more butter to make the bitter butter better, that’s not the exactly the tongue twister good that you made a mistake, I wanted you to make a mistake, is it impossible for you to get this tongue twister some amount of practice required yeah but without practice its plane impossible for you to get this right? True true. I will give you one another tongue twister. Ok. She sells sea shells in the sea shore we have been narrating this from ages like; can you try do narrating this? Can you repeat it one more time? She sells sea shells in the sea shore she sells sea shells in the sea shore yeah yeah exactly its difficult the point here is that there are certain things that comes by practice certain things that they are very difficult to do it on the first time right? a simple sentence like as good as it gets say that as good as it gets see that’s easy, certain things are easy certain things are difficult I some of this in the fizzbuzz is very hyped a programming example and its of discourages people thinking that they are not very good programmers yeah right? with practice I am sure you can do a super fizzbuzz programme too according to me super fizzbuzz you give as input some bunch of numbers and you should display which numbers which multiples to display and which multiples not to display right? Like a variant of visible right? so I think we should not take these things very seriously all that matters here is enormous amount of practice, you keep practicing I am sure fizz buzz is just a very bad candidate example anything for that matter will be a kick off go ok? so my call for all programmers learning especially in our course is that there are going to be questions that are not going to be straight forward that you will find it difficult to code that’s to be perfectly fine with a few attempts you will be able to do it, my sincere request for you all is not to switch on
 
the timer then coding right? Fizzbuzz is probably difficult for you but given one hours time do you think you will not be able to solve it, so programming should not be timed according to me. Forget all the competitive programming challenges. Programming according to me is an art it should be treated like an art at least up to the point but you reach that and say you are an expert and then you try competitive programming but until the point you master programming I think you should be slow, you should be deficient and you should not time your programming. So do these experiments take an innocent programmer who doesn’t know a whole lot of programming but he is newly introduced to programming some students from let say from joc course and gave them good amount of time and motivate him tell him about this fizz buzz and I am sure he can solve it. Ok in last videos we saw that the programme we wrote a programme but we think that logic is correct but still we are not getting the desired output so we will see out what’s problem in the so you can see here in fifteen I am getting fizz I should get fizz buzz but I am not getting the fizzbuzz and according to me the logic is correct still I am getting fizz only, I should get fizz buzz. Actually the problem is that what we are doing is whenever a number is coming first we are trying to find whether that number is multiple of three then if it is not multiple of three then we are checking whether it is a multiple of five and if it is not both the multiple of three and five if it is not multiple of five then we are checking that multiple of three and five then, we are showing fizz buzz ,now see let me debug this, let me go through all the numbers suppose if I am getting number three it will get a three mod three is zero it means that three is divisible by three I will get a fizz. For six also will show me six mod three is zero six is divisible by three if ten comes then ten is not divisible by three and ten mod three is not zero reminder is not zero then it will go to the next condition else ten mod five is zero hence it will print buzz perfect for twelve if twelve comes twelve mod three is zero ok fine it will show fizz let say fifteen when fifteen comes the first condition is I mod fifteen is equal to zero which means fifteen mod three is equal to zero yes fifteen mod three is zero so it will just print fizz and get out of the element that’s the problem hence the first the problem is first condition is I mod three its only checking for three divisibility but we have to check for both three and five if it is divisible by three and five both then you should print fizzbuzz and then only you check for three and five hence I will change the conditions here let me re write the code ok so I will write here if I mod three is equal to zero and I will check for both I mod five is equal to zero and print I plus equal to fizz buzz else if it is not divisible by both then I will check if it is divisible by three if I mod three is equal to zero then I will print let me copy this print fizz else if it is divisible by five then print buzz else it means that it is not divisible by three and five just print ok it is always good to write a function for whatever programme you are writing here I just wrote the logic by code here but it is better if I define a function and then call that function I just into function fizz buzz in here I will give the range value let’s say python don’t take care of the indentation code is huge and you will find difficulties while printing that’s why we are using spyder indentation where it automatically it if you are using some other difficult for you guys to do the indentation or you can use the sub line text also but we recommend you to use spyder this is ok I can call this function from the terminal I will just run this I will call the function fizzbuzz and the range I will use this r here again run this we will call the function fizzbuzz and the range let’s check one two fizz four buzz fizz nine is fizz twelve is buzz fifteen is fizzbuzz eighteen is fizz twenty is buzz ok you can even write the function you can

even call the function here that contains fizzbuzz and you can give fifty one and I will run this cool so we are done with the fizzbuzz programme you can even modify this programme you can create your own game something like that you can change the numbers in a conventional fizzbuzz game we use three and five you can use some other numbers some other prime numbers ok we strongly recommend you guys to play with ait and if you are getting some new question regarding fizzbuzz and new ideas also please discuss on the discussion form ok it will help other guys also it will create more new ideas for us and for you guys ok we will meet again good luck all the best.
CROWD COMPUTING – JUST ESTIMATE 01
Sir, can I speak to you for five minutes? Hey hi Ravi, how are you? I am fine, Something is bothering me so much, I am humming this really melodies Hindi song from nineties, Their hero talk’s about heroines anklets and it was shot in a south Indian temple I am unable to recall that, Will you please help me with that, So a south Indian temple and a Hindi song, south Indian temple and a Hindi song, You said in the nineties film, Ya nineties, And what was in the lyrics, I don’t know hero was praising heroines anklets or I remember it something to do with heroines anklets, Anything in the lyrics some two three words, No, tried goggling it, Sir I tried goggling it but I couldn’t find the result appropriate result for that, Ok,So its very difficult to find now, You need know with the lyrics nor do you know can you hum the song? No. How can we find now? Ok so maybe we can think of let asks someone may be who knows both south and north, they should know. You are the best example for that, ha ha you have south Indian friends and north Indian friends and you love Hindi songs ok that reminds me ok I have both south Indian as well as north Indian friends I have loads of them on face book, yeah and maybe we should try posting it there one or the other person will see it and let’s see whether he can answer huh? That’s a great idea ok super. Oh my god! This is awesome I really want to learn the science behind it let me ask the professor. Ravi saw what just happened with our little exercise, see all that we did was we went to face book and we I add a line on your behalf and it was wonderful to see that is less than ten minutes, ten to eleven minutes I believe, we got the final answer what is most surprising there? Is that the first hit was wrong second hit was also wrong if I am not wrong right? The third hit was “The song” how do you think that this happen? Any guess, see goggle did not help us right? Asking us expert of bollywood may not be of any help, if you simple say south Indian temple nineties bollywood song and finally saying that it has some lyrics about the anklet of the heroine may not land you anywhere, what just happened? I don’t know actually I am very curious w couldn’t find it in Google and within thirteen minutes we find it in face book, that’s right see what just happened is called it’s a very popular social computing technique it’s about asking people to solve problem and a bunch of people come and solve a problem but then you see we got the answer free of cost we didn’t invested any infrastructure that’s because on face book you have a whole lot of well wishers who don’t mind helping you out correct? I roughly have some five thousand friends on my friend list and out I am sure not all of them would have come forward to help me, some of them came forward out of them only a few people knew something about this song we have many many friend on my friend list who are outside India right they may not know anything about bollywood correct? They off course are of no use there are roughly two thousand three thousand people who probably watch lot of bollywood songs and a part of them tried helped me out and a
 
part of them could help me out with some inputs out of which one was the right answer, right? This is how social computing works. Sir I have a question, do you think this works every time? Or for every one? Yeah that’s a good interesting question you need big numbers let’s say you have some two hundred friends in your friend list if you try posting this may be ten to fifteen would be interested to talk to you about it and two or three will give you some hits that may not be right, so bigger the number more the merrier seems to be here right? This is precisely how your Wikipedia works this is precisely how your stack exchange works where you go and post a question you will get an answer immediately just the way we got an answer right now, this is how the even quora works right? So imagine imagine if you were asking this question some twenty years back you wouldn’t ever get to a solution, yeah. The only possible solution here was face book there are many application where you switch on the application on your mobile it will listen to the music of the song and tell you what the song is but that useless here because you dint know what the song was, you dint even know you couldn’t even hum the song right? You just gave some bare minimum details and you got the answer. What is more surprising is that you could not Google it, could you? No. we tried it Googling it and it shows up something else, it is no way close to the answer correct? So there are kind of questions where you won’t get answers in Google but with your friends help you can get it in face book, that’s right, perfectly. So we can even hypothesise by saying the problems of the world and the problems of our county, can be outsourced and rather crowd sourced and we can ask people to talk about it and we might even get the best possible answers, this is precisely what’s goes by the name wisdom of the crowds, where the power of many can beat the power of one super intellectual. That’s very interesting.
CROWD COMPUTING – JUST ESTIMATE 02
The professor just now explained “the power of crowd”, you see crowd is not a bunch of people they are the people who answer my question quora or create articles on Wikipedia which I read how crowd can helpful in many ways. It can help me to find out the number of gems in this jar or help me to estimate or calculate the weight of this bag. You must be wondering how, let me show you. Estimate the number of gems in this jar? One eighty, Two twenty, Four hundred, Around six hundred, Thousand, Five hundred, Three hundred may be, five fifty. It’s around fifteen hundred, two thousand, five hundred, five hundred? Ok I expect above five hundred, two hundred and fifty, fifteen hundred ok, two fifty four hundred, one thousand ten, two hundred only two hundred? Two fifty, two hundred, two hundred, two fifty, three hundred, three fifty, two sixty three, two seventy five, three hundred, two fifty, two twenty, one seventy, hundred, seven hundred and twenty, five hundred, six fifty, three hundred probably, one seven eight one, two twenty, seven hundred, what is this all about? Will let you know say two hundred, seven hundred approx, one seventy, five hundred, ok let’s say one ninety seven, two fifty, around two hundred, hundred and fifty, two seventy, two thousand two thousand? I think two fifty, hundred and twenty five, three fifty, four fifty, around three twenty, four sixty seven, thousand, three hundred, I will get one after that sure, if you guess it right, ok then two fifty, six hundred, five hundred, one twenty, two fifty, one fifty, four hundred, five hundred, not more than three fifty, four hundred, four hundred? Three hundred, two fifty, and what about you sir three hundred ok hey guys guess what happened? There were actually three seventy five gems in the jar and the crowd guessed it right. I know no bodies guess was exact but if we take the mean of all their guesses it is actually coming out to be close to three seventy five wanna know how? Let me show you. As you all know we conducted an experiment which numbers of people were asked about the number of gems or candies in the jar, all though nobody guessed it right but still we got the right answer, how? Let us find out. This kind of experiment was first conducted by Francis Galton in a country fare, ox weight judging it competition was organised in which around eight hundred tickets were issued, every participant were asked about the weight of the ox. The actual weight of the ox was one one nine eight lbs and if we take the median of all the estimates it came out to be one two zero seven lbs as you can see one two zero seven lbs is very much near to one one nine eight lbs this is the wisdom of crowd, this is the part of crowd. So now I would like to explain the reason behind it why does wisdom of crowd prove out to be very useful here? So let us look at this picture we have actual value ok, some people under estimate the actual value of the ox and some people over estimate the actual value of the ox. Ok the under estimation part and the over estimation part it actually cancels out so what is obtained at the end is the actual value. This is the same principal that is playing behind me. For example we have given data comprising of minus three minus two minus one zero one two three here we have median as zero for example zero is the actual value here and some people guessed it one some people guessed it two and some people guessed it three and some people under
 
estimated the value like minus one minus two minus three ok nut if we take the difference of the values of the median here will get minus one, one, minus two, two, minus three and three and then we take the summation of all these values in at the end get the median of the data, this is the same principal that is playing behind the wisdom of crowds and this is the same principal that is playing behind the median of the data ok, the under estimation part actually cancels the over estimation part and the answer that we got from the wisdom of crowd from many people estimate is actually the actual value of the ox. So as I said over estimation minus under estimation will comes out to be zero so the answer that is obtained from the estimates of the crowd is actually the actual value is the true value of the ox. So what we did in our experiment was we asked people about the number of candies or gems in the jar, in our experiment around seventy five people participated the actual number of gems in the jar were three hundred seventy five the median of the data that is obtained is three hundred and the average of all the estimates that is been obtained is three fifty one so as you can see the median is not giving us the right answer here, even the average the mean of all the estimates is giving us the right answer here so according to the recent studies it has been observed that if we take the other aggregate measures then they can also be prove to be useful in these kinds of experiment I repeat recent studies have shown that if we take the other aggregate measures than these aggregate measure can be prove to be more useful in these kinds of experiment. So in these kinds of experiment you have to calculate the number of aggregate measures but aggregate measures are main you have to calculate median mean and other things so here we calculated the average of all the estimates and that came out to be three fifty one and as you know as you can see three fifty one is close to three seventy five as compare to the median that is three hundred so here we calculated the average of all the estimate and that came out to be near to actual number of gems here we didn’t calculate mean as total number of the estimates some of all the estimates divided by total number of the estimates, we didn’t calculated mean by this formula what we did was we calculated ten percent trimmed mean, what is ten percent trimmed mean? Let us find out. In ten percent trimmed mean what you have to do is , you have to remove the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values the sample that has been obtained by this method you have to calculate the mean of the sample obtained, yes here we are using ten percent trimmed mean you can use five percent, eight percent trimmed mean as per your data actually its depends on the data but on our data that we obtained from seventy five people ten percent trimmed mean give us the right answer gave us the answer that was very near to the actual value, so how can we calculate ten percent trimmed mean? First of all you have to remove the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values, how can you obtained ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values? In this particular thing you have to sort the data what do I mean by the sorting the data? Sorting means arranging the elements in ascending or descending order so if we sort the data, if we arrange the elements in the ascending order it will be easier to calculate the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values and then you can easily remove them from the sample, after that you have to calculate the mean of the sample that has been obtained after removing the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values this is how you can calculate trimmed mean. So as I already said this is the wisdom of crowd, this is the power of crowd, these kinds of experiment explains the wisdom of crowds in the better fashion ok so what is wisdom of crowds? And we look out its definition it is actually the collective opinion of

group of individuals, collecting opinion is always better than the expert opinion. Yes collective opinion is always better than the expert opinion; if we take the expert opinion in these kinds of experiments it won’t be as accurate as collective opinion, you can do that actually ask the number of gems in the jar from an expert and you can actually ask the number of gems in the jar from crowd. The collective opinion of the crowd is always the better than the expert opinion. There is another example from a day to day life based on wisdom of crowd and that is Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a crowd source here any one can write edit articles as you know anyone can write and edit articles on Wikipedia. There is also an encyclopaedia available online called Britannica, Britannica is curetted by experts and Wikipedia is curetted by people like us by the crowd, if we take the comparative study of Wikipedia and Britannica recent studies recent research has shown that Wikipedia is as good a Britannica, yes this is right, Wikipedia is as good as Britannica isn’t it amazing and an encyclopaedia that has been curetted by crowd by the normal people and an encyclopaedia that has been curetted by the experts you can do the comparative analyses you will get to know about it that encyclopaedia that has been curetted by crowd is as good encyclopaedia that has been curetted by the experts. So this is another example of wisdom of crowd.
CROWD COMPUTING – JUST ESTIMATE 03
So before jumping to the programming part of crowd computing let us try to manually analyse this data, As you know we collected the from seventy five people we have the data from seventy five people, The guesses of seventy five people as you know the actual number of gents in the jar were three seventy five and if u look at the data, Some people over estimated it some people guessed it seven twenty, One zero one zero and fifteen hundred and two thousand two, But some people also underestimated it, Some people guessed it hundred, one fifty, Two hundred, Two fifty, Three hundred, So this is the underestimation part many people underestimated the data and many people over estimated the data, As I said the over estimation part it cancels the under estimation part, So the average that comes out is actually near to the actual value so if we calculate the average of this data let us calculate this basically average from a1 to a75 yes, it is coming out to be four twenty six point three seven but guys recall remember that we don’t calculate this mean, this mean is basically some of all the estimates divided by total number of estimates what we do here is we calculate the trimmed mean so I will basically delete this. So how can we calculate the trimmed mean? Trimmed mean is basically you to remove the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values it depends on you whether you take ten percent or twenty percent but be careful in your choice, here we will be calculating through ten percent trimmed mean for ten percent trimmed mean we have to remove the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values. How can you do that? First of all you have to sort the data sort the data means arranging the data in ascending order so here first of all what I will do is I will sort the data in ascending order, how can you do that in a spreadsheet? Just go to data and click on sort sheet by column a I will just do that because no other columns here so I will just do that hey w have sorted the data as you know hundred one twenty one fifty one ninety seven you can figure out that this data is sorted in ascending order so now what we have to do is, we have to remove the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values and we take the ten percent of seventy five it comes out to be seven point five I will basically take the floor value so I will remove the seven smallest and seven largest values let us do that so we remove hundred, one twenty, one fifty, one fifty, one fifty there are five values have been removed so two more are still to go so remove one seventy and one seventy five too so I have removed seven smallest values, now it’s time to remove seven largest values let us go till the end and remove the seven largest vales so, I will remove two thousand, one seven eight six, fifteen hundred, fifteen hundred so three more are still to go will remove this one zero one zero, will remove thousand and will remove seven twenty too so after deleting the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values this sample has been obtained from one eighty to basically to seven hundred so I will like you to calculate the average of this particular sample rather than the previous sample so will calculate it, will just put the formula here again in this spreadsheet its average from sorry average from a8 to a68 exactly so we calculate the average as I said it
 
came out to be three fifty one. It is basically three fifty one point six and the actual number of gems in the jar were three seventy five as you can see that its very very near to the actual value, it is an amazing concept the wisdom of crowd if we it comes into play in many of our day to day experiences and many of the things experience so look here as you know we calculated the trimmed mean and the trimmed mean is come out to be three fifty one point six which is actually very near to three seventy five that is the actual value, isn’t this amazing?
CROWD COMPUTING – JUST ESTIMATE 04
So let us try to program this particular concept, first of all I will take a list name estimates in which I will store the estimate of seventy five people I have this data here or so, I will just copy paste as you know we have to calculate the trimmed mean for trimmed mean we have to sort the data so I will just sort this particular list by using the functions sort this let us check whether there it has been sorted or not? Length of estimates just prints the values so that we get to know that, estimate list has been sorted. I just run this, as you can see the list has been sorted we can see hundred, one twenty, one fifty, one seventy, one seventy five the sort function is by default sorts the data in ascending order, I repeat the sort function by default sorts the data in ascending function in ascending order so don’t link this so now calculate the trimmed value as you know we are calculating the ten percent trimmed mean here so what do we do here? Will calculate the trimmed value as point one of length of estimates but here we can see that it will give us floor value or decimal value. So will type cast to int so that we obtain an integer value out of it. Here point one into seventy five will be seven point five but if will type cast to int it will take the floor value so seven point five into seventy five point one will be seven point five and it will take the floor value so TV will become seven. now what we have to do here is we have to delete the smallest ten percent values and largest ten percent values so first of all let us move the smallest ten percent value it is very easy in python you can just start the list from TV it will remove the first ten percent values if you want to check let us check here for I in range length of estimates we have to print here print estimates of I let us try to check this now yes we got the values here as you know initially it started from hundred but now it is starting from one eighty that means it has moved the smallest ten percent values so now let us try to remove the largest ten percent values here to so it is also very easy here in python we just remove the largest ten percent values for that we have to decrease the length of the estimates we will just take it from length of estimate to minus TV it will remove the largest ten percent values. Now we have to calculate the mean of this particular list that has been obtained by removing the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values. So I will just what I will do here I will just use the function mean here that has been already defined in python that is mean you have to calculate the mean of estimates but mean function has been defined in library statistics so we have to import that, import that from statistics import mean, so that we can use here, so let us try to run this particular programme and check whether the mean that we calculated in the spreadsheet and the mean that we get here is same or not let us try to do that yes it is coming out to be exactly same, it is three fifty one point five nine and as you know that actual value was three seventy five we have discussed this fact earlier when we were discussing the values when we were discussing the estimates in a spreadsheet so as you can see we are don’t with the programme here but in python there is much easier way to calculate the trimmed mean to there is an another way so let us try to do that also here for that you have to import other library that is scipy from scipy you have to import stats import stats. We just have to use the estimate dot sort here we need
 
not use any other estimates because as you can see that we have deleted the values here so we don’t need that here I will just remove that, I just comment it so now what we have to do here is we have to calculate the trimmed mean in python there is a function name trimmed mean which will directly calculate the trimmed mean so it is basically stats dot trim underscore mean you have to supply the particular list on which you have to calculate the trimmed mean so it is estimates here now you have to supply the percentage, the percentage of values that you have to remove from the top and bottom of your list so as we know we are using ten percent here so I will write point one here so the function here is first of all you have to import the stats library here from scipy after that after that the function is trimmed underscore mean in trim underscore mean you have to supply the list that you are operating on that is estimates here and then you have to supply the particular percentage of values that you need to remove from the top and the bottom, it is ten percent here so we will right point one here I will just straight way print the n value here let us try to run this again it is coming out to be three fifty one as you can see the values that we get here is three fifty five point one nine same as we got in spreadsheet same as we got in the programme so as you can see that it is very easy to calculate the trimmed mean in python very much easy in spreadsheet and very much easier than the previous programme. I hope this program was useful to you. Have a nice day happy learning.
CROWD COMPUTING – JUST ESTIMATE 05
Hello everyone, In this programming screen cast I will show you, How can you plot the estimates of the crowd, So that you can to get to know, Which estimates whether median, mean was close to the action value, So how can you plot different numbers on python, Let me show you, For plotting different numbers for plotting any sort of data you have to import one library and that is import matplotlib.pyplot you have to import matplotlib.pyplot I will name it as plt ok, So let me show you how can you plot different numbers I will just write plt.plot and I will pass a list here, So I will pass like one, two, three and four, So let us see our plots first of all you have to save it plot.py. We have a graph here we plot it one two three four, one two three four are plot are plotted on the y axis, Let me show you that here it is one two three four, So in this where you can plot particular data with the help of mat plot lib you must be wondering here we didn’t pass any x value, But in python it automatically generates the x values if u dint pass any, I repeat in python it automatically generates the x value if you don’t pass any, Now I will show you if you want to pass x value then how will it look like, So I will pass one more list and will be like one four nine and sixteen here one two three four will be the x values and one four nine sixteen will play as the y values, So let us see how the plot comes out to be here, So as you can see we change the y values, So we get one four nine sixteen here the line that has been obtained is not is not straight it is curved and one two three four are playing as the x values here, Ok this is how you can plot in python through mat plot lib there are many other options that are available you can also use many other option I will let you know one option is you can use the labels as x labels and y labels you can actually label the x axis and y axis, Here we will do plt.y label I will write some values this is how you can label your x axis and y axis ,Let us see how this happens see we have label here some values ok since I use the y label it will be shown in y axis you can use also x label if you want to use any label in the x axis ok,So this is how you can use the labels and this is how you can plot through mat plot lib,Next if you this is the line graph if you want plot in other fashion if you want to plot dotes in other fashion let me show you how you can do that for example if we if I want to plot in dotes so let us see how can do that. In plt.plot you can write another argument how do you want to plot the data, So I will write RO here, if I write ro let us see how the plot come out to be, see the plot comes to be in the form of red dots, It is one four nine and sixteen, So this is you can plot in form of dotes, Other options are also available for example if you want to plot in the form of red dashes, So you can write R hyphen hyphen in place of RO now let us run. This is how you can plot in the form of red dashes, I will show you some other option too for example if you want to plot in the form of blue squares you will just write BS will just write BS let us run that, Yes here you have plot in the form of blue squares BS stands for blue squares yes it is one four nine and sixteen and there is one more option that is available that is the form of green triangles you can also do that let us run that let us run that, So here you the data in the form of green
 
triangles let us check that, Here we have one four nine and sixteen, So in this way you can plot in the form of red dashes, blue squares and also in the form green triangles, This is how you can plot the data through mat plot lib in python.
CROWD COMPUTING – JUST ESTIMATE 06
Here in this programming screen cast I will show you how can you plot the estimates made by the crowd as I said first of all you have to import the mat plot lob library so, let us import that, import matplotlob.pyplot as plt her is the estimates added that has been given to us so I will just plot this array so let us do that plt.plot I will just write the estimate arrays here, let us plot that sorry it is matplotlib so as I said if you don’t give the x values python generates the x values on its own so since we don’t need any sort of x or y values here we just want to show the estimates here so what I will do here is I will take this estimates array in the x axis and for y axis I will keep it constant I will keep constant y values for all these estimates I repeat I will keep constant y values for all the estimates for that I have to create another array for example another list I will create like y so for I in range length of estimates I will just append any constant value here for example I will take five if so here we need to plot estimates that had been taken in the x axis then we will take y so let us run this programme now, as you can see we have a straight line here but you want to show the estimates these are discreet values not continuous so I will just use ro here or r dash dash I will prefer to use r dash dash, r dash dash in the previous programming screen cast I have explained r dash rash stand for red dash lines so let us run it again so we have the estimates in the form of dash lines red dash lines so now I want to plot the mean and the medium median of all the estimates so that I can get to know that which value is nearer to the actual value so for that as it has been explained in the previous programming screen cast that, that you have to trim the sample you have to trim the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values so let us do that I just first of all sort the estimes, estimate.sort that will arrange the elements in the ascending order after that I have to decide the trim value that is ten percent in our case so I will just say rim values is equal to point one into length of estimates, length of estimates now we also have to type cast with tool so I will just do that in now let us trim the values so now estimate is equal to estimates trimmed values colon it will trim the values from the estimate list we also have to trim the values again so let us do that it will start from the trimmed values, in trimmed value in our case is seven so it will start from seven and it will go till length of estimates minus TV so I will just write the colon here length of estimates minus TV so I array the same has been obtained is from TV from the trimmed value length of estimate minus TV this has been already been this has already been explained from the previous programming screen cast so we are done with the y array we are also done with the estimates array the trim estimates array so now let us plot that the trimmed estimates array there is some error let us cut this x and y must have same dimension ok, now we have to append according to the new length of estimates please note that I will append according to the new length of estimates please note that the length of estimates has changed so we have to append y according to the new length of estimates so let us do that so we have another graph with is showing the estimates please observe that in the previous graph we had till two thousand but in the new graph we have till seven hundred because we have appended the values we have trimmed the ten percent smallest and ten percent largest values so we are done with plotting that so let me now show you which value is nearer to the actual value, actual value in our case is three seventy five so
 
first of all let me plot that I just write plt.plot plus write three seventy five because we are taking constant values and I will represent it by say green triangle so let us run it again so we have three seventy five here now let me calculate the mean and median of this data for that I will import statistics import statistics so it will be like plt.plot first values value is statistics.mean of the estimates and while I was constant that is why I represent by say red dots let us do that red dots run it again so we have red dot here that is the mean of the estimates and the green dot here that is the actual line let us also plot the median of the data so I will just write plt.plot statistics. Median I just write estimates take y as constant and represent it by blue square yes let us run it again so as you can see that blue square that is the median it is here and the mean that is red dot that is major to the actual value and blue square that is the median it is far away from the actual value so actually it depends on the data you have to calculate many aggregate measures like mean, trim mean and median of the data and whichever aggregate measure is nearer to the actual value you can take that these kinds of experiments work on the aggregate measures I hope this programming screen cast was useful to you guys and have a nice day happy learning thank you.
PERMUTATIONS-JUMBLED WORDS 01
Hey, what did you just order I will give a hint ok oh brownie yeah you are right ok you will also do it, yeah! Flavour, yeah! You see what just happened one person asks the other by giving him or her a jumbelled word and says can you tell me the right English word? It is actually very complicated why for the following reason. Look at the word rainbow it is rainbow just seven lettered word and when u jumble it looks something like this are you really one English word which makes sense but if you see all possible combination of this letter seven letters there are not just dozens or hundreds there’s actually more than five thousands possible combinations with this seven letter so it’s practically impossible for a person to guess what a word could be it involves enormous amount of sort of thinking intelligence and seeing through the letters and then putting it in the right order only one among’s the five zero four zero possibilities is actually the right word so similarly we can go on asking a random take a random English word shuffle it and pose it as a challenge right? As an always let us see how to write a computer code for this.
PERMUTATIONS-JUMBLED WORDS 02
A person has a word on his mind he shuffles it and asks the other person to guess what that word would be. This is the game, sounds interesting? I said always this being the joy of computing course let us play this the fun way using our programming skills. Let’s get started.
Before starting up with the programming let me just give you the summary of what the game is all about, this is nothing but there are two players in the game, player one and player two say initially we will starts up with player one’s turn so player two will have some wording in her mind what the person does is he would re arrange the letters of the words, basically he would shuffle the words and write those letters in some random order, in some shuffled order not the original word exactly he would write the shuffled one and present it to person one whose turn is at now so this person is presented with the shuffled word, he is supposed to guess what the actual word would be. If he is able to guess he would get a point and this person would pose a question to the other person and the game goes like this whoever gets the maximum number of points is a winner or it may be draw if both get equal number of points this is how the game will go. So with this kind of strategy let’s play this game using out python programming skills. So let’s starts with it so we have to play the game so play you have got, we have to play the game so for this there is a warning that could be seen here it says undefined name play so we have said we want to play the game what the thing has to be done we have to define it so let’s start defining, define play this is the way by which you would start a function definition so that is play is something that you want to perform this is not something that is already known to the computer so you have to define that this is what is a thing you have to do when I say play so you are giving a definition that’s why you have to use def and then the name whatever you wished to give so I start my thing so as he would see second line appear indented indentation matters here so as long as you maintain this level of indentation all this would be considered as the tasks to be done if think play is called so let’s start off with what all we need to do so we will have two players may be player one he will have some name let me say player one name player one name let us input the name input for him to input we should ask with a suitable message let me start with the message player one please enter your name so this is for player one same you have to repeat with player two, player two name you have to input here input player two please enter your name so alright we have collected the names of the players so initially both the players will start with zero points so let us assign it the points to player one is zero points to player two is zero again and I said that the turns will be alternated so one player would pose the question and the other will have to answer and the next time it is reverse so there are some turns here instead of the players giving the question we would have the computer question to both the players so the thing is like the computer is the third party which would give the questions of the same difficulty to both the players so there would be no biases also with it that is the idea so we will make the computer pose the questions and both players will get turns alternately just like how it happened in the previous scenarios the turns would be alternated and the question will be post by the computer and answer as to be given by the players. So to keep track of whose turn it is
 
let us have some variable or turn initially let it be zero it can be any number its generally a practice in computer science to start counting from zero so that is why we have given zero alright so this game will go on in definitely until the player one of them has to stop this is the two player game definitely we need two players only then competitive spirit will be there as long as both are willing to play the game would continue in case if one of them wants to stop then the game would come to an end so we need to continue it definitely that is being taken care of this thing while loop and condition, condition I am given as one that means true so while true will always be true and we would end this only when the player wants to stop that we will see later. We will be dealing with that too now what should the person do, he has to get the question from the computer, this is basically the computers task, computers task that was to be done here what is it doing? It has to picked word there would be some picked word computer will pick some word so it will have some dictionary from that dictionary it will pick some words so choose that will be a function we will define later so computer is choosing some word and it is written as picked word so that one word is picked from which dictionary or from you can considers as it has some list of words from that list it is picking some word so then it has to create the question this is the task is to create the question, create the question so question is created by jumbling the pick word jumbling is nothing but we are just rearranging the letters of the word, you are jumbling the picked word so now once the question is ready you can print the question. So far so good now let us come to the players part first is should maybe we should start off with the player one as the first player then the player two we will alternate it to keep alternating the turns we should keep track of the value of turn. So turn is set to zero so let it be the case that at turn zero the player one will be playing at turn one player two will be playing at turn two again player one will play at turn three player two will play it goes on this way so you would see at the even values of turn it is the chance of the player one at the odd values it is the chance of player two so to keep track of even and odd we will use modular operator that is nothing but operator which would divide and return the reminder of so to get to know if it is even or odd we can divide the turn value by two and see the reminder for all even numbers reminder will divided by two is zero and for odd numbers the reminder is one so that fact will be making use of it here and we will code. So as I said we are going to use the Modular operator if turn modulo true turn modulo to this equals to zero single equal to is assignment and double equal to is the condition check up of equalities so this basically what it does is it will check it will check this expression turn one two that is it will take the value of turn divided by two and check the reminder if that reminder is equal to zero then this segment has to be executed so you have to say that this is this person turn so let me print a message saying player one name we know the name we
have got the name of the player, player one name this is your turn alright so I have printed this message so I have to get, I have displayed the question here you would have seen here there is a statement print question so computer has to printed the question so that has displayed the question so I have to ask what’s on my mind so that computer is asking what’s on my mind so that the computer is asking what’s on my mind so it has picked some words what is the actual word co it is asking what’s on my wind so you have to get the input for this question the player would given answer that as to be taken as an input so we will do this now. Answer is equal to input of what is on my mind so computer has got some word in its mind so that word the player has to guess so that is the question make sense ok this is the question

posted by the computer and for this question the user will give an answer which would be inputted and stored in this variable ans now, if the answer given by the user is exactly equal to the picked word if this answer is exactly equal to the picked word then you are supposed to increase his points by one so he gets one point so there will be some points already player one has score during the run of the game initially it is zero but when the loop goes on as an when the loop goes on the points will change for the players may be one player would have guessed lot of words but another one would not have been able to do so there is the chance that a difference between the scores exist so we will retrieve the precious for add one to and make it the new score so player one point is nothing but his previous point plus one this is his new score and you have to update him of his new score print your score is like I can say it is stored in this variable points of player one which is stored and we have fetched the new value and we have displayed in this score after this also if this answer is right then the score will be incremented otherwise you should say that if answer is wrong. Hence print the some suitable message and say the correct answer it will be I would say better luck next time I thought the word that is stored in the variable picked word so I thought this particular word like this you are displaying the message to the user irrespective of what happens here the next has to be have to ask if he wants to continue the game or not? So that is for that let us use another variable let us call it c, c for continue probably c you take the input from the user if he wants to continue or not? So may be continue quit there is two possibilities so let me post a message press one to continue and zero to quit so he has to decide if he wants to continue or quit so this is the message post and for this the user will give an input which will be captured by the variable c and we have defined zero is for quit we have said to the user that zero is for quit so in case if he says zero that is I want to quit then input c is zero that is he wants to quit then you have to thank the user probably you can say you have to thank both of them actually because till some point have time they would have played so you have to thank both of them player one name, player two name you have to thank both of them and you have to display the points they have scored till now like before this particular word has occurred player two would have scored some point as well as player one would have got something you have to display the somebody. So unique the two points value has you have to tag them by greeting with their names and showing them the summary of the game till now so you have to thank them and you end the loop you quit the game, how do you do that? You use the break statement so once this break statement is encountered this break statement once when it is encountered the corresponding while loop would come to an end so that is the game will come to an end. This is the game ok so if this is for player one this particular thing whatever we are done till now is for player one next what should I do is for player two the procedure is just the same as whatever we have for the player one now the changes what we have to do is instead of player one name player one points we would be using the player two information there that’s it so let me copy paste everything copied so let me paste it but indentation has to take care of it this has to be done in case if the turn value is odd so for odd turn value it is player two’s turns so I will have to do this indentation so please take care of the indentation it is in the same column, column nine and this is in the column nine yeah this is in the same column and this thing has to be indented now everything looks perfect right? so we have indented this as I said this is not player one this is player two let me make the changes it is player two it is player two and thanking message is just the same whenever if anyone wants

to quit the game comes to an end so you have to thank both of them for their participation till now as well as show them the summary so thanking part is the same just that updating of points defers from player one and player two because each of them have their own task so you need to have two different variables to keep track of both the right let me save till here ok let me revise once again what I have done this is for we start of with the playing of the game here we will ask for the names of the both the players, player one and player two initialise their points zero and to keep track of alternating the turns we use the variable called turn. Computer will create a question here instead of the usual way, where two people will create a question alternatively so this is just for sake because the with the case humans are playing one person has very good vocabulary and he is picking some very difficult words which is not very easy for an average person to guess, he is permuting that he is shuffling the word in a difficult way that may be the case and the other person may choose the simple words that may create the biased state as you could sense till now so to ensure fairness we will give the task of creating the question to the computer so the computer is doing this just guessing what the jumbled word is, is the task of the players so computer starts here this has to be repeated continuously until players want to quit the game so we are using this particular loop while one, computer is choosing the word from its list of words randomly it will choose some words and it will jumbled the picked word and create a question so it is now after creating the question it is displaying the question so you have to alternate the turns so I am using modular operator which would return the reminder after division so for odd numbers it is player two start even number its player one’s turn for odd numbers reminder would be one when divided by two and for even numbers that is zero divided by two that’s that the taken care of here if turn mod two is equal to zero if it is a even turn then it should be the turn of player one because we are starting the turn with zero that is the usual practice in computer science to count from zero so that is why we are doing it, it’s not an issue in case if you start from one as well you can in fact start from any value, the thing is you should alternate the turns between player one and player two as long as you use this mod two as your conditions so this will say this players turn, this is the question has been displayed already what is that the word I have on my mind? That is the question post to the player; the player has to guess his word. So whatever is his he will type the guessed word so if that is the correct guess whatever he has answered is the exact word the computer has picked then the points will be increased by one otherwise there is no increase in points he will intimated of the word the computer has thought and then computer would ask them if you would like to continue the game or quit the game, if they would like to quit you have to greet them you have to thank them for their participation till now and show them the summary of both their scores and you quit the game, you are thanking them you are showing the summary and then you are quitting the game the same goes for player two as well just that updating the points is different see it is the point of the player one is updated and points of player two is updated in case if it is the, so in the turn of the corresponding player his points would be updated in case his answer is correct. That is how this game goes, did you sense any missing gap here , there is a missing gap here also there are some missing definition which we need to do, we would do it in the next videos, in the next video we will see the missing gap and will define and undefined terms now may be choose jumble all these are intuitive to us but the computer may not know what has to be

done so that we need to define them and it is intuitive to us define these things, that all we will do it in the next video thanks for watching.
PERMUTATIONS-JUMBLED WORDS 03
Alright, in the previous video you would have seen the outline of our play method so what is the game so we have seen the outline in the previous video may be we will give you a very quick summary we have two players each have been given zero pints initially and there is a variable turn to alternate their turns the computer would randomly pick the list a word from list of words it has jumbled it and then post the question based on whose turn it is player is supposed to guess the word the computer has in its mind he has to give his answer if that is exactly matching with what I computer has thought his point will be increased by one else he would be hide of the correct answer there is no change in his points and the next thing is ask the player wants to continue the game or not even if one player says I want to quit the game the game comes to an end because this is a two player game so the game comes to an end so once the player says I want to quit you need to update them of status till now and thank them for their participation and then you quit the game this is what is the outline you have seen till now. I said there is some missing gaps in the precious video I hope you would have sensed the gap let us try fixing it if you would see here the turn value is initialise to zero then if it is even it is player one’s turn odd is player two’s turn but have I updated the value of turn I haven’t so that should be done close the missing gap here observe the indentation it has to be exactly indented with this if turn mod two is equals to zero that is one turn is them you have to increment the value of turn you have to increase the turn is equal to turn plus one so you have incremented please observe the indentation this is in column nine as well as this is in column nine fine so indentation is fine now play method is over so I have what did does is as I had given the outline everything is perfect and while the players turn is over the value of turn is incremented by one so that the next player can take his turn if you would try running it and turn is equal to zero it is the player one turn to play the game then turn values is increased so now the new turn value is one so this is the turn of player two at two against it goes to player one at three it goes to player two so at every value of turn which is an even number player one gets a chance to play and that odd values player two get chance to play this is how the game goes but the programme is not yet complete still he first thing is here we have send choose the word so the computer has to choose the word from the list of words it has so we have define what exactly the computer has to do so will do that here let me say define choose this is something we want the computer to do basically it will have some lists of words so now let me start off with some random words some random English words let me say rainbow computer science, computer science basically then programming this may be some word then mathematics let us move away slightly from academics player this is a word condition this could be a word reverse some word and one two three four five six seven eight so may be let me have two more words let us make it a list of ten words you may have any number of words that’s never a problem you can increase it to hundred words thousand words you can have if you have lot of words during the continuous playing of the game it will be fun because there is a lot for the computer there is a lot of challenge for the computer to choose a word then pick any word you can get any word it will be fun so let me say water this is a water and then we would say boat let me say boat these are the words I have just some
 
random words I have given these are the list of words so from this list of words it has to randomly choose a word so for randomly choosing a built in library or random let me import it import random I have imported random library now I can what are all the functionality we find in the library so I would say random. Choice I say randomly you need to choose from this list. So the default functionality for it is random.choice so in that random library there is a function for choice which will pick some element from your list so words is a list of our words so you have to pick something from list let me say pick equals random.choice this is a pre defined function and then the choice from the list of the words so from this list of words you pick the random word that is what just line means so after the word is picked just return this pick so now if you would see choose you say choose the control would come here it sees the list of words random.choice of words it sees this command so picks random words from this list and returns that value that returned value is taken as the picked word that is assigned a picked word so this is how the picked word things works now so we have faced this and then something which is not defined to the computer is jumbled let us do that now ok I have to define jumbled, jumble or a given word let me say, you have some word is given to you, you have to jumble that word that is nothing but the you are shuffling the word or you are rearranging the letters that’s what you are doing. So for this as well you have something in random library you have some functionality it is called random.sample so you choose some words from this word you choose some letters from this word how many letters you have to post? May be actually I need all these letters so length of this particular word so what do I do this? I need to choose some number of letters from this word. How many numbers of letters? Basically all the letters I need to choose in some random order, I need to choose all the letters in some random orders for example let us take one word water, w a t e r there are five letters and five positions blank positions for our shuffled word I need to choose some letter from these five letters so from the five letter word consider all the five letters but the thing is you pick any one letter in a random order so maybe, I may pick tea, so tea is assigned in the first position, in for second position from the remaining I will pick one letter may be or so on this is how random word would be generated and this would be written as a list but what we need it as, we need it as a word so list is nothing but it would written as for example water let me say t r a w e this is the way it has picked the letters t r a w e will be the five elements in your list. But we want to merge those five elements, those five characters and make it as a single word so we are basically what we want is we need to join those things so for doing this there is a functionality called join so maybe, I would say join these things and for this join functionality we will generally give a separator that is in case you have a space you terminate your join there something like that may be if I would have some words where there are some spaces you terminate there, terminate at a place where you need basically if you would have learnt about string tokenizer this sounds as an complicated terminology that’s very simple nothing but if you are I will just give a simple example there is some sentence that has been given to you, you need to count how many words are there in the sentence how would you so that? Count the number of spaces, the space acts as a separator between the words, so counting the number of spaces will give you a hint on how many words are there in the sentence so something like that so space acts as a separator so some separator has to be given based on which joining as to occur that is when as soon as you see the separator you perform this operation, perform the join operation, here I don’t want to see any specific separator may

be space or a comma or a pull stop on seeing that only I want to perform this operation I don’t want to something like that so let me just give the blank character this blank character.join that is don’t see anything just keep joining the letters so t r a v a w e is the order I just randomly said so just keep joining them so just take t again just keep joining r take the next letter a join take the next letter w join take the next letter e join and this is how this particular functionality works. So this is basically separator, in case if I give some other separator what could happen is only one seeing that particular separation that separator this particular operation would be static I don’t want that, I want that to be happening irrespective of whatever be the character so I just give a blank character this is a syntax that has been define so we are following it so let me say this is my jumbled word so after every individual character as been joined I get back to the word let me call that word has the jumbled word alright so once jumbled word is time you return this jumbled word, so this jumbled word is nothing but your question, so when you say question jumble of pick word the word is taken the letter of the word are shuffled that is the letters of the word are separated and they are randomly picked and you could get a list, you join the element of the list to get back a single word and you return that single word this is how this functionality works. And something else have we defined everything, just check once, we are getting the name points and turn choose has been just now defined then jumbled we just now have defined and now if we have something here we don’t have to defined yeah thank yeah thank here is needs to be defined, fine so let’s do that as well let’s do that. Define thank, I have passed player one name player two name player one’s points and player two’s point I have passed these four values so what should I do? I have to print player one name I have to print his name and say your score is, player ones score I have to display and will have to do the same thing for player two as well let me copy paste this sorry let me copy let me copy and paste it I just need to do some modification so that this is player two’s name and player two’s score has to be and you have to thank them for their participation till now, maybe I would say thanks for playing ok then I will have to print let me just say have a nice day this is purely your wish whatever you need to display is nearly your wish I will just print have a nice day. Sorry I need to give a bracket. Everything looks good let summarise we have define the play functionality we input the names of two players initially have their points at zero there is a variable turn to track of whose turn it is and the turn is alternative that is taken care by this mod two operator the task of creating the question is given to the computer, the computer will choose from its list of words, jumbled the letters of the word then display the question so based on the question and the turn the player will be given a chance to guess what the actual word is. So the guess will be taken and it will be compare whether the answer he has given and the actual word is the same, in case if it is the same his points will be increased by one and it is updated here. He is updated of his new score here, and then in case if his answer is wrong you just intimate the correct answer and don’t update the score in here and you will be giving him the chance whether he wants to continue the game or he wants to quit. This is the two player game so if one person wants to quit the game comes to an end in case if they choose to quit you have to greet them thank them show them the summary of the game till now and then you quit the game, each and every functionality for that choosing random word that random library we had used so from the list of words randomly you pick a word and return it so this is what the choose functionality does and jumbling is nothing but, you randomly select the letter from the

word you keep it in some order and then you list the merge of those letters in different order what you have, what you have at time you merge you join the letters that is what you are doing here and you return the jumbled words and in thanking this is purely your creativity and this you are updating him of the status till now you are giving the summary of the game he has played till now, so you are giving the summary and you greet him with some nice lines basically this is what you are doing and see there is something that we missed here it’s your score you need to display the players true score stat playing this game. Let me run, play this alright, player one let me enter your name let me say abc player two xyz some where it is coding ok this is wrong let me continue this is computer ok score is one, let me continue this is science computer science ok so as you could see the game is very interesting you can go on and on the thing that makes you difficult is when the number of letters increase as you could see here this was difficult for me to guess because there were so many letters here and as the number of letters increase the complexity so you try playing by long words in English you try doing it and there may be some variations in the game as well you can limit the number of guesses here I am just telling I am giving one chance if it is correct I will increase the point else I will say you are wrong may be you can have a variant in which you would give the player more chances to play the game he can take some three guesses something like that the creativity part is all in your hands so creativity sky is the limit please do try different variants and do discuss in the discussion form of how you have implemented those variants thanks for watching this video have a nice day.
THEORY OF EVOLUTION 01
Hey avni, how fascinating it is we have a wall power thing cellular body to this form yeah but this is not a single time process you know it takes millions of years to change into this current form from a single cellular form and a single cell has a collective sticks with changes with time, brilliant yeah and the recent studies have shown that the single segment of dna contains a huge amount of information, nice, I would like to stimulate this evolution process through competition. Let us try. You saw the conversation between avni and simran, avni is trying to explain to simran that there is some sort of randomness involved in evolution of species from one to the other we all know that life started off as amoeba and now we are as Homo sapiens humans. The randomness attached to this so called explanation of what intense evolution can actually be stimulated the exact model is little complicated so what will do is we will try stimulating it at a very different level well yes we can stimulate and see how evolution has happened in fact there is a very popular topic called genetic algorithms just precisely this it learns from evolution or how amoeba became human being and that very perches one can mimic and used that as a sort of technology to come out with brand new ways of accomplishing something. So what we will do is genetic algorithms say is way out of the scope of this course I will try to tell you something which is a very very very tone down version of genetic algorithms in fact biology’s and people who actually know genetic algorithms might even complaining by saying what am I teaching you people but I am teaching this in keeping in mind of the brand beginners in programming who may not have any idea of programming, either programming nor biology. But still for its a very interesting topic to just like that discuss and then write a piece of code. So what we will do is we take a huge binary strength let say some twenty digit binary strength all of them are zeros the rule is simple, you pick some digit randomly and make zero for one with a same probability you know how to do this you now are familiar with the random function right you say you import random and then you can use a lot of functions within that you are very familiar with tat, using that you can do this the point is you take some digit in this twenty digit string and in case that digit is a zero you make it one with the small probability keep doing it and eventually you will see all the zeros will become ones. How much time does it take? It’s based on the length of the string and the probability which you switch zeros to ones sounds complicated but don’t worry the programme is actually very easy once you understand this you can in fact go ahead and study what makes the genetic algorithm but again as a asset out of the scope of our joy of computing course which is at the very foundation basic level but you will have all the interest on earth to go and study and even understand what makes genetic algorithms, so let us now go ahead and see screen cast of how to execute this program.
 THEORY OF EVOLUTION 02
Hey everyone, as you all say I just had a conversation with my friend avni and I am really fascinated by this idea of evolution. Evolution is actually the change in inheritable characteristics over successive generation and how this change happens? This change happens through genes, genes have dna and dna have coding information in the form of beds in the form of zeros and ones and if this information changes if zero becomes one or one become zero it actually needs to evolution so I will like to code this particular fact but before jumping to the programming screen cast of evolution let me give you some prerequisites, first of all we will be looking at the concept of file handling in python how can you read and write files in python? We will be looking at txt file the files with dot text extensions so let us start with that. So here I have a file named file one dot txt you can create your own file. So here is my file I have written hello, how are you in it as you can see hello how are you has been written here I need to read this file and write something in it so how can you do that? How can you realise through python? So first of all you have to open this file so let us do that, we will just write with open your particular file name, my file name is file one dot txt and a signer name to it for example I will add a sign my file and I have to read that file so I will use a function read here I will just print what has been written in the file so I will just write file one dot no you have named it my file dot read let us do that see, it has read the file. We wrote hello how are you and it is the reading the file as hello how are you, so it is working for example now I write, we want to write I am fine in the file so how can you write? I just use the write function here for reading the read function and then the same way I will use the write function here my file dot write for example I want to write I am fine, ok after that please not the fact that you have to close the file so I will just close the file my file dot close, close function is used to close the function here so let us run it there is some error here that is unsupported operation that is not writeable yes this file is not writeable so I will just write in w mode there are different modes in which you can open the files, r is used for reading mode and w is used for writing mode. So I need to write the file so I just use w mode so let us run it again now the exception is now the error is not readable so we need to read and write the file simultaneously so there is another mode that is r plus mode there are various modes in which you can open the file, I will use r plus mode r plus mode opens the file read as well as write please note this fact so I will run it again. So here we have I am fine now if you read the file you have I am fine in this so let me check that, our file was file one dot txt let me open it again. So since we executed it twice we have I am fine I am fine again in this so let me show you by zooming it we have I am fine I am fine twice since we ran it twice, so this is how we can read and write files here so the error we encountered here was that we have to open the file in particular modes so if we want to open the file in reading mode then you can only read. If you can want to open the file in w mode then you can only write and if it is R plus then you can read as well as write. So there are many such modes in which you can open the file let us explore that. For example here we have different modes so here we have different modes we have R mode in which read mode is used, W in which write mode is used to edit and write new information to the file and we also have A mode that is appending mode, you observe
 
this fact when I wrote I am fine in the file hello how are you, it got erased off so if we I opened the file in A mode that is in append mode then hello how are you would stay in the file and I am fine would be appended in the file and next is R plus that we use just use it is use to read and write the files and yes special read and write mode which is used to handle both the actions when working with the file. So there are four modes in which you can open the file first is R that is read mode next is W for write mode third is appending mode in which you can append the data in which you can append means add the data to the file ok by not erasing the precious data and the fourth one is the R plus mode that is the special mode if you want to read and write the file simultaneously. In this way you can do the file handling in python,
THEORY OF EVOLUTION 03
There is another prerequisite that is required for evolution programming screen cast and that is random library. Random library is basically used to generate random numbers, I will explain you some of the functions in random library, so first of all start with rand in I will just write random dot ranint one to five. So as you can see it has generated an integer from one to five rand int is basically is used to generate a random integer from one to five please note the fact that one to five one and five are includes here it may generate one two three four or five let us run it again and see the randomness involved here now it has generated four again, again it has generated two again four five so as you can see that five is inclusive here that’s why it is generating five. Again five four one so basically it has generated every number except three let us run it again nor it has generated three also so random dot ranint is basically used to generate the random integer in the given range, in which the both the range are inclusive I use another function here random dot range please specify the range here I will again specify one to five so let us look at the output of random dot range, sorry its random dot ran range so let us do that this is four one three one two two four three as you can see that it has generated five so ran range basically generated number from one two upper limit minus one it will generate number it will either generate number one two three or four it won’t generate five because it generated number from lower limit to upper limit minus one. This is how ran range works. There is another function name random dot random it will generate number from zero to one, it will basically generate decimal numbers from zero to one so let us run it. As you can see that it has generated point four five it will if we run it again it has generated point four zero, point eight three, point five three, point six two, point four seven, point nine two, point six two, point seven three, point eight eight, point eight three, point five two, point zero five four as you can see that every decimal number that has been generated here is from zero to one so random for random is basically used to generate random numbers random decimal numbers from zero to one. There is another thing involved in random dot ranrange let us explore that. And that is for example I want to generate numbers from one to nine so I will write here one comma ten and I want to take a step of two I only want to generate for example odd numbers so I will write two here it will either generate one three five seven or nine let us look at this for example it has generated nine, let us check whether it generates only odd numbers or not one three one three again odd number again odd number odd number odd number odd number again odd number odd number odd number as you can see it is only generating odd numbers so how you can make random dot randrange work like that, you just need to specify the range and also you also need to specify the step that random dot randrange has to take for example here I specify two because if it will generate one then with the step of two it can only generate random odd numbers so if you want to generate random even numbers let us do that too for that I have to start with two then it will generate only even numbers and I will generate till eleven because ten is also odd number even number so let us run it so it has generated eight ten even number even even even even so as you can see that it is only generating even numbers that’s how you can make random dot randrange to generate even and odd numbers and many others and many other numbers of
 
your choice this is how it works. There are many functions involved in random library you can always Google it and explore many other functions so just I will give you brief of that. So here we have many functions involved. Will have random dot choices we have random dot set state get state randrange choice shuffle sample, random dot uniform, random dot triangular, random dot beta I will suggest you to go through all these random library functions they are pretty interesting I will give you a demonstration of another function that is random dot choice let us do that, random dot choice basically generates random numbers from given list so I specify the list here for example I specify one two three four so it can only generated numbers from this particular list that I have specified here so it has generated three one four two as you can see it can only generate number from the particular list, you can also specify the list for example I will specify the list is my list is equal to any number you can specify one one, forty five, sixty seven, eighty nine ok so random dot choice you have to generate from my list so let us try executing it. So it has generated eighty nine since we gave only four numbers eleven, forty five, sixty seven, eighty nine it has generated eighty nine run it again it has generated eleven, eleven again forty five, forty five, eighty nine, eighty nine, forty five as you can see that it is generating number from the list that is specified, we have specified the list has eleven, forty five, sixty seven, eighty nine and it is only generating numbers only from that. So I will encourage you to explore more and more about random libraries it has many other instructing functions too.
THEORY OF EVOLUTION 04
Now, we are done with the prerequisites required for to run screen cast of evolution. So let us start with the programme of evolution. Here we are given a dna file name dna underscore data has explained earlier every evolution process happens through dna and it has some coded information in the form of zeros and ones so we are this particular information zeros and ones so first of all we have to read this file that has the coded information I hope that we have watched the previous programming screen cast in which we explained how to handle files through python. So I will be using that straight away, so I will just write with open my file name is DNA underscore txt DNA underscore data dot txt as my file. So I will just read it, I read it bit by bit and store it in ‘x’ so I just write my file dot read as explained read is used to read the file, read function is used to read the file here I will also make x as a list so that we can use it as a list. We have a list of zeros and ones we need to store it in list so I will just convert it into list. We have ten thousand beds given in that DNA file so I will call it function on this ten thousand bits so I will just write for I in range zero to ten thousand, I will call a function evolve here evolve ‘X’. Now that we are done with reading the file we have also created a list x that stores the DNA information I will just call the function evolve on that particular list and that is ‘x’ so I will just define it, define evolve this is called on the function this is called on the list ‘x’ so I will just write index here I want to generate an index randomly in the list ‘x’ I repeat I want to generate an index randomly in the list ‘x’ so to generate randomly we use as I explained random library so I will just write random dot randint we have to generate from zero to length of the ‘X’ as explained in random dot randint we have to specify the range and for that range the both limits the upper limit and lower limit they both are inclusive. Then I also need to generate another variable randomly here I will call it ‘P’, I will again use a random int function here random dot randint and I too I need to generate it from one to hundred so algorithm that we are using here is if this particular variable ‘P’ if it will be equal to one then only the change will takes place so I will just write here if ‘P’ is equal to is equal to one then only the change will take place if the bed at index position at ind is equal to is equal to zero then it will be changed to one is equal to is equal to one. Else it will be changed to zero obviously, so I will explain again what we are doing here is we are generating two variables randomly here first is the index of the variable of the particular bed in which change has to take place this change actually depends on the variable ‘P’ which will which will generate randomly if this particular variable ‘P’ will be equal to one then only the change at this particular index ind will takes place if ‘X’ at int is equal to is equal to zero then it will be change to one otherwise it will be changed to zero so first of all it all depends on P. If the P that has been generated randomly here is equal to one then only the particular bed at Ind position in ‘X’ will be changed the change will takes place. This is how we are using we are using the evolve function here. So now we are done with reading the file we are also done with the defining the evolve function here so I will just print here again I will just print ‘X’ again so let me do that let me run it again so there is some error that is list index out of range so I will just look into it, we have ind here and we are generating it from zero to length of ‘X’ so here is the problem we generating till length of the ‘X’ we should
 
generate it from length of ‘X minus one’ since we all know that randrange generates the random value in which the both ints of the range are inclusive the upper limit and the lower limit are inclusive and we have in list the numbers that are generated the indices values are always from zero to length minus one I repeat in list we always have indices values from zero to length minus one ok. If we have given a list of length five then we have indices in list as zero one two three or four we don’t have five here and random dot randed generates random values in which both the ints of range are inclusive so we have to write length as ‘X minus one’ in this particular case the problem will be solved so let us run it again so we have an array here again the array the list that we read from that particular file it has come out here so you can actually print the ‘P’ and ind values and check whether the changes taken palace or not so I will just print the ‘P’ value and see whether the changes are taking part or not so let me print it so it is generating ten thousand times so let me see whether it is whether the value is one at the particular instance are not so let us look at it we have seventy eight, eighty five, eighty one till now we have a I haven’t encountered one oh here we have one so in this particular case we have one so this particular case the change would have taken place ok you can always try run it and check whether the change is taking place or not we have one again so in this particular case the change will take place otherwise the change will not take place so please note down the fact in mind so I don’t think we have another one here let us check it again so you can try run this particular algorithm this particular programme and see whether the change is taking place or not I hope this programming screen cast is useful to you guys have a nice day happy leaning.
