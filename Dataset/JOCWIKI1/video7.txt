SNAKES AND LADDERS – NOT ON THE BOARD 01
Six, that will be one two three four five and six. You will get another chance, oh! Six oh oh ok right one, that’s a one you are on thirty seven that perfect, four, one two three and four. So the game that we are playing is called snake and ladders the game again involves a whole a lot of randomness and there is no place for logic or thinking so the idea is very simple, you start with two pawns as you can see, I am red and she is blue we start with one and this is a dice where I roll and then if it’s five I start with keeping I start keeping five so let’s say for example we both are here and I roll this it is two and one two and then she rolls, can you roll bhawana? It’s three and she puts three and whenever we encounter a ladder we climb up and whenever we encounter a snake, a snake bites you see we come down to its tale and then continue you see assuming I climb up like this and finally come here finally come in here just in case I put two from here the snake bites and I may have to come down to twenty three so that’s the rule of the game, the point is anyone who reaches hundred wins the game. So bhawana where were we I think I was eighty one, you were on eighty one, I was on eighty seven ok yah perfect and I should I play maybe I play once more, I think you were about to getting bite by snakes so let’s go, but I was explaining the game I think I should get a second choice. No no I don’t think in this game you will get a second choice hey come on I am not a cheater cock so let’s continue from here one two ok fine I will accept that it was two!
SNAKES AND LADDERS – NOT ON THE BOARD 02
You saw this game it has very simple rules anybody can follow it and start playing it immediately, so what you do is you roll a dice and move your pawn accordingly assume you are on let’s say fifteen number fifteen you roll a dice and you get a five which means your pawn moves sixteen seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty and twenty in case if it’s a snake you come down a few units if it’s a ladder you going up a few units so this game is very popular all over the world although it originated in India it is now very well known in different parts of the world and there are variants for this game as well so that aside we will now see how we can write a piece of code to stimulate this game, where two people can simply sit in front of their computer and then play so a word of advice since you people are beginning to code you needn’t worry s o much about doing the exact stimulation, putting a board and displaying a snake and ladder may not be required let us do it with playing text. Let’s see how this can be done.
SNAKES AND LADDERS: NOT ON THE BOARD 03
Alright we just now saw favourite game of most of us in childhood snake and ladder being played by two persons, now let us play using a computer programme.
Hello all welcome to the programming screen cast of snake and ladder, in this programming screen cast I will take you down your memory lane where you had played one of the favourite games of I guess almost most of you in your childhood namely the snake and ladders, snake and ladder the board would generally consist of numbers from one to hundred arranged in a ten cross ten grid there would be snakes in some point and ladder in some points ladder would generally take you up the board that is from lower point to a higher point and snakes would generally takes you down the board from higher point to a lower point, this sort of symbolises theme of life that life is full of ups and downs so this would be favourite game for many people because if is somehow close to the real life scenario alright let us now see how we shall play this game in a very cool manner using our python code through our computers. Alright let’s get started. Before getting started with the code I will show you the image of a snake and ladder board I had got an image from an internet this is here this is a snake and ladder board as I had said there are numbers from one to hundred in an ten cross ten fashion there are ladders somewhere as well as snakes somewhere I am sure you would have played this game in your childhood this is just journey down the memory lane alright, I would ask you guys to please pause this video at this moment make a note of snakes and ladders in this board various points from where to where is the transition of each ladder. For example this particular ladder starts at twenty one and takes you to eighty two and this particular snakes starts at sixty four and this takes you to thirty six like that you please make a note of this snakes and ladders by pausing the video, this would be of greater interest to us during the later part of our code, please pause the video at this point and make a note of the snakes and ladders alright I hope you would have paused and made a note of the snakes and ladders now let’s get started with the coding part let me minimise this image let just started with the coding part when someone plays the game what are the two things you suppose to do, in the computer someone is going to play the game you are suppose to show him the board I call that as show board functionality the next is he is suppose to play the players are supposed to play and the end point of the snake and ladder we have to define, this snake and ladder this board has end point at hundred, hundred is the winning position ,when some player reaches hundred first he is considered as the winner, two players would play and the one who reaches hundred first is consider to have won the game till than the game will proceed in case the player wants to bought in the middle he can totally quit the game if the players continuously proceed hundred is considered as the winning position, this is how we are going to configure our game here so as I said first you are suppose to show the board to the players then you have to ask them to play this is the higher level abstraction details and this is considered to be good programming practice that has to, you have to abstract as much as possible like see a person who wants just an higher level overview he would read this he would understand the entire point is hundred and you are suppose to show the board and play the person is suppose to play this is what the game expects someone to do so this is the higher level overview so this is considered to be a good programming practice to give a higher level
 
overview, your code must be organised such that by reading these overview the person should be able to get the higher level idea of what your code will do and if they want to del deep into the code then you may allow them into del deep into it but for a person who just need high level overview he should not be made to go through the final details unnecessarily this is considered to be a good programming practice for this purpose we are using different functions and another use of functions is reusability if you want to repeatedly do something and if you want to reuse that the if you want to use the same functionality at various places then functions come to your rescue they greatly help in reusability so it is very good programming practice to use functions as much as possible and the higher level overview must be easily obtained for any one so the naming of functions also I recommend that you give such that it is easily understandable by someone it is also the syntactically it is corrective you can say f one f two f three function f, f one f two f three and so on but it doesn’t give the overview of what is the function may contains some twenty thirty lines of code or may be more than that as well as an how the requirement is for the code may grow longer and longer that maybe there but to understand what that particular function say f one is doing you have to go through those hundreds of lines of codes and understand this is not good programming practice so to facilitate that a good practice is to name the function accordingly suppose the function is in calculating the matrix multiplication say just for example I am using it matrixes have got nothing to do with this game now I am just giving an example suppose the function is performing matrix multiplication you are suppose to name it as matrix multiply that is a good convention so that just by the name the person who needs a higher level overview can get it without getting deep into the code so this is the good practice please make a note of it and use functions as much as possible because it simplifies your work greatly alright so now let’s gets started with it, we have to get deep into the functions, show board and play are the two functionalities and now I need to say what this show board has to do so let me close this image, now I don’t think it is needed, let me close this because in show board I am suppose to open the image again, show board functionality this is the functionality, this is a image file so I have to import the image library from the package PIL input image library this is how I have imported the image library so let me now open the image img is the object that captures the image, image dot open here you are suppose to give the file path where the image file is present in my case it is present in the same directory as that of my code so I am just giving the file name in case you have stored your image in a different path please do specify the complete path so that the image shall be opened alright now once the image is opened it has to be shown so I will say image dot show this open show all these are pre defined functions in the image library and as you would see as I had said they had given the names such that you can understand what it does what it does, image dot show there will be a lot of transformations involved in showing from as you know computers deal every in terms of binaries zero and ones from that to a image that is understandable by humans to transform there are a lot of steps involved but all these are abstracted at what we know is, if you say show it will show the image so that is enough for us we need not del deep into the binary level information so in this way your functions must be named open show all these are self explanatory what this particular thing is going is clearly understandable just by this so htis is the show board functionality currently I am not going to code for play so let me command it but this will also be an important step so I have return it and command it and once show

board works will go with play, let us we had written the code for show board let us see if the board is being shown then we will go with the next functionality play I will save this file and I will run this see the image is shown, so this is the image that is that has been shown also the board will be shown so this functionality works fine no problem with this let me close this now and ok the next thing is we have to go with this particular functionality play we will see what are the other functionalities required in play if it requires any other functionalities or any other libraries has to be imported as and when we del deep into we import and we will define new functions we will make the code more readable and if you just give this code probably to your maybe younger sibling maybe ten, twelve years old sibling who barely understands English that person just by seeing the names would be able to understand what are the checks that are being performed how the flow of programming is, everything would be very clear we will make it in such a way we will modularised this program this particular process is called modularisation like you split the you split the single units of tasks into chunks like show board this is one particular task I have made it once chunk and play is one chunk the play consist of some sub chunks we are making the functionalities into chunks so that anyone can get the higher level overview, even test it someone who just understand English with the names they would be able to understand what is the flow of the program, you may check that alright we have done with show board functionality let us go into play functionality
SNAKES AND LADDERS: NOT ON THE BOARD 04
Alright guys, in the previous video you would have seen the method of show board the functionality I had mentioned here, I had written the code board for functionality so that the board is shown to the player now what is pending is the play functionality, let us see what is needed in play functionality ok I had commander it back then because I want you to show that show board functionality works so now play is require so I will remove the ash so that its now no longer a command and now we want play functionality to find play here as I said in this game we having two players p one and p two let us save them p one will have some name because we want to have it as personalised interface, it should not just be like player one player two he had got a sweet name, we need to refer to him by it by his name then he will be very very happy so we need to refer to him by his name and lets input his name from him lets input his name input is taken by this functionality raw input we are inputting a string so it is taken by raw input, string is nothing but a set of characters names generally consists if characters right so that is what technically we call it as string this is a string so we use raw input functionality to input strings so this is the message that has to be displayed. what should we be displaying? Maybe we shall say player one please enter your name looks good alright the same has to be done to player two as well, instead of typing it again let me copy and paste this and do the modifications wherever needed, it is player two’s name and it is player two so the first would be inputting the player one’s name and then inputting player two’s name so let me command that as well for completion sake input player one name this is input player two name why do we have commands is? To help us understand the code at later point of time. Maybe when you are doing this now maybe you will find it later easier but once you have done sufficient number of exercises and when you want to look back at what you had done previously that time there may be some confusions so to avoid that we have commands where we write in English format that is understandable by us we can look back to the commands and then get to know the syntax that has been used and all that, it would be easier for our revision if needed so that is why we are using commands alright, so initially both are starting at that is they don’t have their, they have their dice placed on the floor not on the board so they will roll the dice based on what the number appears they will place it on the snake and ladder board so ground let me denote it by point zero player one has points zero this is nothing but I will command this as well initial points of player one, player one has got point zero alright? Ok the same as to be repeated for player two so let me copy and paste it this is for player two so I will just give a summary of this four lines we input player ones name the same we do it for player two then we have set the initial points of both the players to zero and there will be one variable it will denote whose turn it is, let me initialise it with zero, you can initialise it one as well but in computers generally the counting starts from zero so I have done it with zero but it is not mistake even if you start from one so the game will be played continuously so let me say while one this is nothing but an infinite loop the game would be played continuously so I have put an infinite loop here I guess most of you would have some confusion here that I said when you reach the end points the game ends but here I am saying the game will be played continuously how is that possible? You would have it is not
 
contradicting this is a doubt you may have so it will become clear as the code proceeds there is a check inside whether the end points has been reached or not if end point has been reached then we will break this loop, break this loop is nothing but we come out of the game that is what we call as break this loop this is a infinite loop that will be broken that is the game would end when you reach the end point the check would be perform at a later point alright so turn zero is for player one so I would check turn zero is for player one turn one then I will increase the value of turn by one and I will increment if by one so turn will become one turn one will be for player two turn two will be again for player one turn three will be again for player two so every turn is alternated so if you would observe the pattern here turn zero two four six and so on for player one and turn one three five seven so on are for player two this could be abstracted from this way that to take the value of turn you divide it by two and take the reminder if that is zero that is the turn of player one otherwise it is the turn of player two so to check the reminder we have the operator mod which is denoted by percentage we will be using that now if turn mod two equals equal zero note that single equal to is assignment it is nothing but you are assigning the value as zeros let the value be anything I don’t care, I want it to be zero then you have to use a single equal to here you have to check the equality I don’t want to change the value I want to fetch that value I want to compare it with some standard value in that case you have to use the double equal to symbol please note this point ok if that is the if this is the turn then this is player ones turn player ones turn this is alright this has to be notified to the player so I will print a message player ones name his name has to be mentioned I will say your turn player one this is your turn a message has been put and I had said the player may want to quit the game in the middle as well we have to give him this options till you reach the points hundred I don’t want to I want to quit it even that option will have to be given to him for that matlab this will give more personalised feeling that is why we are giving this option as well that I will take it as his choice so c nothing but ask players approval to continue asks players wish, players choice let me say that as players choice to continue this is what will be doing next let me call this as c, c for choice or whether he wants to continue you can take it anyway I will just call this c or you can name it as choice as well that is up to you I am using c input see that was the function I was used previously the raw input that was a specialised function to input strings nothing but something like name or your address something like that to input that you will use raw input here I will ask one or zero one will denote he wants to continue zero denotes he want to quit the game so I would input his choice I will have to say him press one to continue and zero to quit so I will get his input if his choice is zero if the choice is zero I will have to the scores and I will have to quit the game so let me show the scores the points is stored in pp one and pp two, pp one is the points of player one, pp two is points of player two. First the player ones name has to be mentioned player ones name quote here the points this has to be mentioned and the same thing has to be done for player two as well so I am copying and pasting it player two points of player two this is done, you have to mention the points and you have to say quitting the game quitting the game thanks for playing something like that just a humble message, a message has been displayed and now we have to come out of the loop that is this all these are for the user to give a personalised experience to the user we are using all these print statements but what is the instruction to be given to the computer to get out of the loop is this statement break, break statement will come out of the loop and it will end the game basically that’s what this will do

here and otherwise if choice is zero this would be executed if not it would just come here observe the indents, indentation is important here it is in the same level of if so if c equals equals to zero this check would be made if the user hasn’t pressed zero that is he doesn’t want to quit it would come directly to line number forty here which is in the same indent level here you are suppose to roll a dice let me when you roll a dice you would get some number that let me store it in a variable called dice so to roll a dice to stimulate this what happens is what happens when you roll a dice some random number from one to six something from one to six would come when you roll a dice so I to stimulate this what should I give the instruction to the computer is you pick a random number from one to six to give this instruction I have to use this random package random library has to be imported I will say import random this is the library that is needed since we needed it we imported it here now I will say random dot the functionality is randint this is the functionality randint this requires few to give the end points that is what should be the start value and what should be the end value, the start value is one in our case and end value is six, this particular functionality would generate a random number from one two three four five six this is what this functionality is doing, you generate a random number this is basically stimulation of rolling a dice alright we have generated a random number now you are suppose to display what was showed by the dice, print dice showed dice showed the points that is captured by this variables dice so dice showed this point is printed to the user and now once this is once the dice has been rolled you have to add that many number of points to your already, already the points whatever you have to that you must add this points so let us do that. P one this variable p p one stores the points of player one this is nothing whatever is the pint take it you add the value of dice so that will be your new points and when you are playing the snake and ladder sometimes the it may happen that when you reach some position there may be a snake or they may be a ladder so accordingly your points will increase or decrease the change has to occur so to stimulate that let us say the points one is nothing but you check if there is a ladder at this particular points if you think why do I pass the same parameter here and here is this particular line what it does is it will add the points add the points here I guess the name would clarifies so commands is not needed but why do we pass this here and here I will explain, this is the place where you have landed after rolling the dice now you are suppose to check if that particular position has got a ladder if that has got a ladder your points this particular value of this particular value of pp one the points is no longer valid some higher points you would get so that higher value of points would be stored here so that is why we are using same variable pp one in both the cases I hope it is clear in it will be clear when we deal deep into this particular functionality check ladder this may be a ladder a positive thing which will increase your points or it may happened that it is a snake check if it is a snake of the same the same way check ladder and check snake are two functionalities which we will define later these are the things that we have to do and sometimes it may happen that in some points you are all at say ninety five you are at position ninety five and your dice showed six so when you add here ninety five plus six is one not one but your dice has board has just hundred so what will you do then you will stop at hundred and you would say that you have won so that particular check has to be done here so this is I am sorry for this, this is the same players player ones points has to be changed I am sorry for that and here as I had said you have to check in case during this addition process have you gone beyond the end point so in that case you have to

come back to the end point so that check let us make, if the points, points of player one has exceeded end, end point then you are suppose to say you bring it to end point that is ninety five he was present, six came up so he is supposed to go to one not one since the board ended at hundred you stop at hundred that is what we are stimulating here, this is to the functionality here is to check if the player goes beyond the board beyond the board this is being check here alright? Now you are suppose to print him his score as of now you say his name player one name your score your score is this value pp one that is storing the points of player one alright, if he has reached the end points as I have said earlier this is an infinite loop you may wonder that when you have reach the end point you have to quit the game but here we have given an infinite loop now to break this loop we are performing a particular check if you have reached the end, if you have reached the end with this current points that is whether this particular current points is the end point or not here checking if the person has reached the end I am sorry I have used the extra bracket its seems sorry if it’s just a space if this if this particular player has reached the end you are suppose to print the message player one name his name you are supposed to give and won player one this person has won the game you are suppose to display it and once you had displayed it you come out of the loop you break that this particular place we are using break because the user wants to quit the game here we are breaking that is here we are quitting the game because one person has reached the end point this is the check for player one this is a player ones turn anything maybe possible right player one may reach the end point player two may reach the end point so we will perform all this checks in player two as well alright let get back to this if turn then else this all this whatever we had done are for player one let us the same as to be repeated for player two so let us copy paste everything copy ok let me paste it this is for player two player two you will modify everything to player two player two sorry this is player one I am sorry for this because here the player wants to quit and we are suppose to display both their points this is player one and player two and now here it is player two is player so his points are added so layer two player two alright player two player two player two player two player two player two layer two player two alright so we are given rough overview of the game let us save this up to here I will give you the summary of what all just happened till now we have inputted the name of two players we have initially set their points to zero and we have some variable called turn which will actually keep track of who has to play now and the turns zero two four six and so on are for player one, one three five seven and so on for player two to keep track of that we are using this particular operator modulo denoted by percentage which will return the reminder after the divisions so we are dividing it by two if the reminder turns out to be zero it is player ones turn otherwise it is player two turn so one thing I guess I skipped here is I skipper here is I should have should have incremented the turn, yeah I should increment the turn right? Once one player has done I should give the chance to the next person so for that I need to increment the turn that I have to do I have done that alright so what in each players turn what are the checks that are being performed let me tell you that, first we say that it is his turn we are asking if he wants to continue or quit if he is quitting we specify the status till now as to how many each person has scored and we are quitting the game, in case he wants to continue we are rolling the dice, dice would give you a number from one to six some random number that number is added to his points and then it is possible that, that particular position there may be a snake or a ladder we will be performing a check there if that is a snake or

ladder and appropriately the points would be changed and in case during the process of rolling a dice the points exceeded the end point as I had given an example earlier if the position was ninety five and the dice showed have six addition would give one not one where as your board just as hundred so end point exceeded so in that case we should bring back to end point so this check has been performed here and after that and after performing all the check after performing the normalisation part we are displaying his score and we are checking if that particular position is the end point or not if the person has reached the end point is declared that this person has won and here we quit the game, the quitting here is due to the users choice quitting here is due to reaching of end point that is the difference here the same thing is done for player two as well alright so the higher level overview of what play does is given to you and check snake check ladder reached end these are the three functionalities we have defined here that is we have we have just given the names here what this particular functionality is suppose to do we will define later we will be defining in next few minutes let’s see to it. I hope you have understood what all happened till now you may pause for sometime look back to what has happened, you proceed once you got all the pieces till now clear.
SNAKES AND LADDERS: NOT ON THE BOARD 05
Alright guys, in the precious video we had seen how to display the board as well as higher level overview of the game playing so in that we had used some functionalities like some functionality we had used it like check snake, check ladder we will define that now define check snake or check ladder may we let us start with it check snake check ladder initial view I had asked you guys to make a note of all these points where ladders were there the points where it start the point where it ended I had asked you guys to make a note of it, I hope you would have made a note of it based on that we will be writing this code if the first ladder we saw was at eight so we say check ladder this takes an argument points so some specific points is given we are checking if there is some ladder at that point and if there is a ladder we will return what will be the new points after crossing that ladder that will be returned if the points is equals to eight this is where we have the first ladder then you are suppose to print that you have to notify the user that he has actual stepped on to ladder you print that this is a ladder then you return the new position the ladder at eight actually landed at twenty six so you return twenty six now the next ladder is at twenty one twenty one the thing is the same so let me copy paste it or I will type ladder this ladder lands you at eighty two so I will return eighty two so the same pattern will continue for other ladders too so let me copy paste this block after twenty one the next ladder is at forty three that is taking you to seventy seven the next ladder is at fifty that is taking you to ninety one the next ladder is at fifty four that is taking you to ninety three the next ladder is at sixty two it is taking you to ninety six the next ladder is at sixty six it is taking you to eighty seven the next ladder is at eighty that is taking you to hundred the end point here if you haven’t stepped into any of these points that is once after a dice is rolled we check whether that is a ladder point are not these were the ladder points if the points at which we are making a check by synch match any of these things that means you have not stepped into a ladder so you get beck the points what was added you don’t have any bonus so else this is not a ladder not a ladder so you return the same points that is no addition of points no increment of points nothing is there no change in points just return back what you got this is how check ladder functionality works. Alright! In a similar fashion we can write check snake functionality check snake the first snake you have is at forty four let me check that if points aright this event takes an argument points at this particular point whether there is snake or not if points is equal to the first snake is at forty four if that is equal to forty four you have to print snake you have stepped into a snake you need to note the player so you have to print the snake so snakes will bring down your points so you will come down to twenty two so that you have to return it I will say points is the next snake is at forty six right? print snake print snake and then you return the value where it takes you back it will take you to five so return five the snake at forty six is taking you down to five so you are returning so this is the pattern for all the other points so let me copy paste this ok the next snake is at forty eight that will take you to nine the next snake is at fifty two that will take you to eleven the next snake is at fifty five it is taking you to seven the next is at fifty nine that will take you to seventeen the next is at sixty four it will take you to thirty six the next is at sixty nine that is taking you to thirty three the next is at seventy three it will take
 
you soon to one the next is at eighty three that is taking you to nineteen the next is at ninety two that will take you to fifty one the next is at ninety five it will take you to twenty four the next is at ninety eight it is taking you to twenty eight else these were the points where there were snakes otherwise you have not stepped into a snake not a snake so there is no change in points you just return back the same points this is how check for snake has been made this is nothing this is very simple that I had shown you a board in the very first video when I have asked you to pause the video and make a note of the snake and ladder where it starts where it takes you to based on that I had written this code, you check if it is those special points in that case you display a message whether you have sadder at a snake or ladder and accordingly you modify the points you return the modified points so now I guess you could get it in the play functionality when we were using see we add the points and we check if that points is a ladder if it is a ladder here you will get the modifies points if it is not a ladder you would get back the same point here similarly the check snake functionality also works, the difference is ladder takes you from a lower point to a higher point if you step into a ladder, snake will take you from a higher point to a lower point if you step into a snake that is only difference if you didn’t step into a snake or a ladder you would retain the same points alright, so these two functionalities are over so reached end this particular functionality is to be realised let us do that now, realise is nothing but now you del deep into a to check the code nothing but you give the code that is what you call as realise reached end at this particular points you are checking whether you have reached end nothing if the particular points is equal to end point you say true else you say false that is the logic this is the plain thing there is an end point defined you just check whether this given value is equal to that end point if that is the case then you return true true else you return false this is how this works let me save and I am getting an error is it input only I guess the same input will work input I guess it will work yeah oh that is the raw input for other use I am sorry for this confusion this is input, input works alright so we are almost done with the code everything has been defined see the code has been modularised well the first thing we have to do is we have to show the board then we have to play, he next step is we are playing the next step is we are playing, first we show the board then we play that is the what we are doing this, so this is the highest level of overview so now if you want to know what this particular show board functionality doing is we have an image file we take it open it and show the image that is the that is what this particular functionality show board is doing then the next functionality is the play functionality which is our main functionality here what you do is, you input the names of two players you initially set their points to zero you have some variable call turn which denotes which player has to play now then you ask him if he wants to say that this is this person turn if he wants to continue or quit the same so based on that if he wants to quit, you quit the game there by denoting the status till now or if he wants to continue you roll a dice based on what, what is shown up in the dice you add his points and then check if he has landed in a snake or a ladder if so you modify his points otherwise you do it you do not do anything you just retain his points so that basically what you do is you add his points and then you check if he has landed into a ladder or into a snake and sometimes it may happen that during the process of rolling a dice you may go out of the board in that case you are supposed to stop at the end of the board itself so this check is done here then you display his score and say if he has won when his points is exactly the end points you just you have to check if he has reached the end

point or not, if he has reached the end point you say that he has won this is the higher level overview you have a variable turn denotes who has to play if he wants to quit display the status and quit otherwise roll a dice add points check if has landed into a ladder or a snake and if he has reached the end points you quit the game, this is the higher level overview now the detail functionalities checking ladder checking snake this I had defined based on the board I had shown to you, to check those specific points if that particular point has been reached you display that he had stepped into a ladder or snake appropriately and then you return the points where he will land finally, you return that if he hasn’t stepped into it just return back the same points so that there is no change in the points that’s how these things works and reached end this functionality what it check is whether the points this person has got is same as the defined end point or not this is the check performed here, this occurs continuously and one of the condition will lead to quitting if the game, one is the player voluntarily wants to quit the game the second condition is someone has reached the end point these are the two constrain these are the two places where the game will quit alright this is how we have coded now you please pause and see till now what has happened or you understand the functionalities, you understand the overview level as well as to the details in depth you proceed from this way itself, these are the major functionalities now let me tell deep into it this way you just consider you have been given a big box you open that box then get a smaller box then you open it then you get a smaller box this is how we are organised a code you understand this well and this once you are very clear with it will proceed with the running of this program alright please pause and understand this very well.
SNAKES AND LADDERS – NOT ON THE BOARD 06
Alright, till now we have coded the snake and ladder game we have split into various functionalities for easier understanding I hope you had revised it, you had gone through all the functionalities you are clear with what each functionalities is doing, now let us run and see this. The board has been displayed and here you are supposed to enter your name so maybe let me say abc is my first name, my first player name is abc and second one let him be xyz, abc this is your turn you have to continue or you have to quit? I want to continue the dice showed six and see the initial points was zero abc score is six now because the dice showed six and there was no snake and ladder at that point so the score remain six only now this is xyz turn if you want to continue or quit, I want to continue, dice again showed six so currently both are in the same status, you want to continue yes the dice showed three so I am at nine I want to continue yes both are at the same place, yes I want to continue it’s getting interesting I want to continue wow now here the player two has an upper hand this is going interesting you can play on and on the whole day good luck. You have got great pass time now great guys now let me quit this but I am gonna play this tonight, I won’t think that I will sleep tonight this is so good I am so happy with this, I am gonna play this I hope you guys too enjoyed this thank you for watching, have a nice day.
SPIRAL TRAVERSING – LET’S ANIMATE
Well luckily with animation fantasy is your friend said the great film makers Steven Spielberg so let us open the world of animation with our next choice spiral traversing.
SPIRAL TRAVERSING - LET’S ANIMATE 01
We have been looking at pretty straight forward programming questions, nothing has been very challenging a questions so for. I would now like to give you a question which actually isn’t straight forward which requires a whole lot of thinking and of course programming time. So let me pose the question for you all, do you see the animation here? What’s happening? You just seeing the white dots spiralling around and going to the centre in a particular way correct? How easy for us to do this? Well! Isn’t all it appears though it’s pretty straight forward it is not that easy, firstly how can you even do such an animation so let me go step by step and explain to you all how we can actually fill the entire screen with white dotes in this particular fashion, forget what I showed you let us go step by step. Do you now see this four cross four entry of numbers there are numbers one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen and I want the numbers to be displayed in the following way, firstly it should be one two three four and then you must climb down eight twelve sixteen and then towards your left fifteen fourteen thirteen and then up nine five and then right six seven down eleven left ten you should basically traverse this table with these numbers these way alright? What do I mean by that? All I mean is, you should display this numbers in this particular fashion only let me try to be more clear with a nice example so here is the exact question, if the input is four, you create a four cross four table like this in your program don’t display it, just create it and each cell corresponds to a row and column isn’t it? Look at this first cell it is first row first column I am gonna call it one comma one I will create a list or maybe a tuple whatever is comfortable for you and then use that term one comma one to denote this cell, the second one first row second column this will be one comma two likewise one comma three, one comma four, two comma one, two comma two, two comma three and so on up to four comma four so the input is the dimension of the table if the input was five you should come out with the five cross five table it was six, six comma six if its n in general it’s going to be n cross n so given four I create this four cross four tuples one comma one, one comma two so on and then I want to display them in the following order only remember the spiral thing that I showed you, I want it in that order only by that I mean observe one one, one two, one three, one four, two four, three four, four four, four three, four two, four one, three one, two one, two two , two three, three three and three two should be the order in which you must display, you see where I am getting that given a n cross n table you must spiral n like this what is spiralling n you must simply display this addresses of the cells as simple as that, so input is a number some ten and you must create a ten cross ten table and spiral n on that table and display it. Remember we started off with this little graphics animation every simple and straight forward one, looks like the animation of animation that was done some forty years back animation is so sophisticated right now this is far to be regarded an animation but then as a practice exercise I wanted you to all understand doing something as simple as this requires good amount of thinking, I spoke to you about displaying the entries of table right? I am going to use that right now and I am going to show you how we can create this graphics animation using just simple idea of taking n and displaying n cross n cells in a particular way, you now know enough to go ahead and write a
 
quick program which will do the animation, let us see how this is done, amit will now show you how to use your knowledge of displaying the cells in the table and create this graphic animation.
SPIRAL TRAVERSING – LET’S ANIMATE 02
Hello guys, in this video is little bit different we are going to do some kind of animation here and in order to do this animation will we don’t need any pre requisites we don’t need to know any graphics or any other libraries but two things we need to understand how to store represent matrix in python, second how to print it in different orders so in this video the main crux of the programme is to print the matrix in the spiral order so what do I mean by the spiral order? It means that you will start from the first element is represented let’s say zero, zero comma zero and then you will print the first row then you will go to the last column and print the last column all the elements of the last column then last row in reverse order then first column in reverse order and so on now why is this important? How I am linking it with the animation? So after this program, after we write this program, after we do the traversing of a matrix in spiral order and do the animation with it, you will be able to make something like this. This is exactly the spiral order traversing of a matrix, you can see as I am printing the first row and last column then last row in reverse order first column reverse order and so on, it will go like this in until it it’s the center so in order to perform this animation I don’t need to understand any, any kind of graphics I just need to know how can I print a matrix in spiral order and use that logic to do this in animation so after this video, after we write the program you will be able to know how can we create such kind of animation or such kind of pattern easily so let’s see this in next video.
SPIRAL TRAVERSING – LET’S ANIMATE 03
Hello guys, let’s see this matrix that we have on the screen, it’s the four cross four matrix with elements one two three four five sic seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen and sixteen so usually how we print, usually in whatever lectures you saw till now in most of them whenever we are using any matrix or printing it or traversing it we usually traverse in row wise manner, what do I mean by the row wise manner? So see this matrix first I go to the first element, my first element is one which is present at zero comma zero so I will go there I will print it, then I will go to the next element, next element is the first row and second column which is here which is the which is two so let’s see this I will go to the second element and I will print it. Then I will go to the third element which is present at first row third column which is three then next element is four first row last column now after printing the first row I will shift to the second row first column which is first element of second row which is five here then I will go to the six, seven, eight, second row is over third row nine. Ten, eleven, twelve, third row is over fourth row thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen see usually we print like this in this program we are not going to do this then we are going to do something else we are going to print the elements of this matrix only let’s say in a different order which is spiral order so let’s, let’s see what do I mean by spiral order. Suppose I have the same matrix I will start with one first element I will print all the elements of the first row which is one, two, three, four then I will not shift to the second row I will just print all the elements of last column which is eight, twelve, sixteen then I will print all the elements all the remaining elements of last row in reverse order which is fifteen, fourteen, thirteen then the first column all the remaining elements in reverse order which is nine and five one is already printed now what is left? In the second row I will print all the elements in the simple order which are left which are six seven I will go to the third row and I will print eleven and I will print after that ten so in this, this is a four cross four matrix then ten is the middle element so this is how we are going to perform and you know if you can print something like this then you just need to add a library which we are going to use a turtle library and with that library rather than just printing the elements will print some kind of dot, coloured dot and it will look like we are animating something so this is what exactly we are going to do so let’s do this.
SPIRAL TRAVERSING – LET’S ANIMATE 04
Hello every one, so in this video we are going to write the program for spiral traversal of the matrix so in the first program I am going to make two programs. In first program will print the matrix in spiral order just what we saw in the last video so will see how we can do this so let’s do this, let me create a function name spiral def spiral and what are the parameters of this function? M is the number of rows then n is the number of columns and ‘a’ is the is my matrix so ‘a’ is actually a list of list through which I will representing the matrix. Let me define two variables one is ‘k’ equal to zero and l is equal to zero, let me tell you what these variables are ‘k’ is actually the starting index of the row which is zero, l is the starting index of the column which is also zero, we know that m is the number of rows in the matrix and n is the number of columns in the matrix so let me write this term, you guys already know that if you want to command multiple lines you have to do with this then you can command multiple lines so let me write this ‘k’ is index of starting row, l is the index of starting column ok now what we have to do? We have to first print the first row, the first row should be fully printed then we have to shift to the last column and print the all the elements of the last columns so let me write a while loop while see ‘k’, ‘k’ is the index of the starting row, starting row index. Why ‘k’ is less than l? Means that ‘k’ is when I am going through all the elements of row so I am exhausting all the rows if I am getting over all the rows then I should not print anything because my rows are over so ‘k’ should be less than m and l should be less than n, what do I mean? L is the starting column index so all the columns are exhausted so when all my rows and end all my columns are exhausted I have to stop the loop, ok while k is less than m and l is less than ‘n’first I have to do is since I am starting first I have to do I have to print all the elements of first row so that let me write a loop, for I in range see elements of first row ok I have to exhaust all the elements through all the columns so I have to go through first column index, second column index keeping my row fixed I have to go through the first column second column third column fourth column and so on so my row index is fixed at a just traverse to the column so I will so my range will be l to ‘n’ to keep this in mind that this ‘n’ is whenever we type range, range starts from suppose you write in the parameter you give in range is zero comma five so it will go like zero one two three four not up to five ok so hence I am writing ‘n’ because n is my number of elements number of columns ok so suppose if I give four it will go to an l is zero so it will zero one two three four times but it will not go up to four as four so I can safely write here ‘n’ ok inside this loop I will print my elements which are print ‘a’ see my row is fixed ok I will just write ‘k’ here because the first ‘k’ index of first row and I so I have to print I have to traverse row all of the columns so I is the column index so row is fixed row is zero and I will print all the elements so the first row. You all know that if I have to print the elements in one line with this space I have to do like this and with apostrophe inverted comma sorry awesome after this when the first row is over I have to go to the second row I have to see I have to go to the second row when the first row is over one two three four I have to go to the second row so second row is important so now here see second row second row but I have to print the elements of last columns eight, twelve, sixteen so in this traversal the my column is fixed where I have to
 
traverse through all the remaining rows see remaining rows are second row, third row and fourth row but the column is fixed column is the last column so I will do this see this before so that we don’t forget here let me command this commanding is the best practice ever you guys should command every time whenever you write a code so that you revisit you can understand what you wrote anyone who is trying to understand your program or trying to reinvent your program or use your program can understand what you did so it’s better to command so let me write here what we did? We print the first row so printing the first row from the reaming rows after this is over when my elements of first row are printed first ok I have to go to the second row so I will do k plus is equal to one which means that now I am on the second row those row index has been increase k is my row index started from zero but now it is of first I mean second row ‘k’ is equal to one now I have to print the elements of last column now here I have to traverse route the remaining rows ok and my column should be fixed so let me write this for I in range my column is fixed you should remember so I have to traverse through the rows so which is k to m which is because I have already incremented my k so it will go to the remaining k the last row m is the last row index because m is the number of rows. I will just print here print ‘a’ I have to traverse through row so ‘i’ column is fixed which is bought n minus one now why here n minus one because again I have to say this because is the number of columns so suppose my number of columns are four since every time list starts from zero so here it should be suppose number of columns are four number of rows are also four I have to put two in order to be in the last column I have to put three here because arrays list always starts from zero so three array I have to put for that I ma putting n minus one here I put k only because k is already zero so I don’t have to take care of minus one here but here I have to take care, again I will write end is equal to grid and my last column is over last column is over means I have to shift my columns to the second last what do I mean by the second last? Since now here n is pointing at let’s say if number of rows and number of columns are four, four n was pointing at four so n minus one was three now I have to shift to the last column so second last column so that for that I have to do n minus equal to one let me again command this line printing the last column form the remaining column awesome! This is done now here is some tricky part let’s see this now we are on the last second last column a last row second last column so we did this now we have to print this ok see the tricky part here is we have to print it in the reverse order, this is the reverse order sixteen after that fifteen, fourteen, thirteen you have to go in the reverse order for that what will you do, if you have to check the number of rows are not exceeding the row index is not exceeding the number of rows why I am doing it again here see I already checked it in the while loop but it might happen that after this condition the k might become that’s a five we should not open here we should not escape the five comes here and not stating this condition that there is a bugging the program so for that I have to put the condition again inside this if it is fine then I will write for I in range ok now what I have to do, I have to start from the second last column I already decremented my n by minus one so I am already on the second last column since n is the number of columns I will start from n minus one where I have to go I have to go to the first column, first column is index at zero now it might happen that since we are doing a generalised program it might occur it might not go to the zero it may for example in this part when I am printing eleven and ten I have to go to ten only I don’t have to go to nine after that ten eleven after that ten ok so I have to go I have to go to the last starting

column index, starting column index for now it is zero ok for now it is zero but it may not be zero after some time so for that I will write n minus one because again the range, range doesn’t go to the doesn’t include this value, it doesn’t include this value but I need this value for that I need l minus one so that I can go to l is at l since I am going in the reverse direction I am decrementing n minus one, n minus two, n minus three, n minus four up to l I have to go I have to write here that’s minus one minus one is my step so by default step is always one positive one so you always go one two three four five suppose you want to go five to one, five four three two one you have to write here you will start form five and up to zero if you want to go up to one n minus one so let me five four three two one this is my step function ok so I will go up to l minus one and inside I will just print my array ‘a’ n minus one row, row minus one and will start last row because I am in the last row an n minus one because m is the number of rows hence you play that’s it. Great! I am done with the last row ok so I will decrement my rows ok because now I am on the last row I want to go to the second last row so I am here I was here printed all the elements of this row I have to go to the second last row I have to decrement my row index not row index I mean number of rows which is m minus one this is done now next is again let me command this line so that I don’t it printing the last row from remaining rows ok now what is left? I am on the second last row, I have to print the elements in the second last row I have to print ok second last row I have to print the elements of the first column in reverse order again ok we have to do this in the reverse order again so for that again I have to check if l is less than n ok if l is less than n then inside this I will write loop for I in range m minus one because is already decremented here and I want to start from the second last row second last row to where the first row I have to go until first row so k minus one ok because I have to go until ‘k’, whatever k is so for now k is one thing of the second row because we printed the elements of first row here and we incremented our k to the second row I want to go to the up till second row so that’s why I am writing k minus one here ok and again step function is minus one because I have to decrement ok and here I will write print ‘a’ I of l that’s it awesome this is done I will just increment my l here because again let me tell you l is the l was the starting column index so after I printed this first column all the elements of first column I have to go to the second column once I printed this I have to go to the second column and again do the same thing which I did here I have to do the this thing again here and next thing here and next thing here next thing here nothing is there sorry so this loop will take care of it ok that’s why you wrote this loop let me command this again printing the first column from the remaining column awesome! This is done our program is ready printed everything now let me create my array so let’s array is ‘a’ ok for I in range how many rows I want? I want four rows for j in range ok for columns let me create a index list here l it’s an for now let me I write the elements like one two three four five six seven eight nine ten up to sixteen so I will take the count variable and put it one and here I will just append the count variable and increment it ok so I have the elements so j will take care of a rows and the elements of four first row let’s say after the first loop of the after the first loop j is over and I append that the list l whatever I got after this loop in the in the in my array ‘a’ in my matrix ‘a’ so ‘a’ dot append l that’s it my ‘a’ is over I have my ‘a’ and I will call the functions spiral, number of let’s say rows are four number of columns are four ‘a’ now let’s see this ok let’s see sorry cool I got my spiral traversal one two three four then eight twelve sixteen fifteen fourteen thirteen nine five six seven eleven ten it is? Yeah. One two three four

eight twelve sixteen fourteen thirteen nine five six seven eleven ten cool so this is over you can check this you can write in a different way this is one of the way of writing this program the spiral traversal you can write in a different way also you can create your own logic there is another way which is known as recursion but not we are we will not cover this because it might get little bit complicated but it is cool, you may check depths how we can write a recursive program to print the elements in spiral order so see this and we are going to use this logic spiral traversal in our main program which is creating the pattern.
SPIRAL TRAVERSING – LET’S ANIMATE 05
Hello every one, now in last video we saw we can traverse some matrix in spiral order now in this video we will see how we can create such animation what we saw in the first video for that we are we are going to use a library named as turtle, if you have installed anaconda the turtle comes with the anaconda, you can check, if it is not there you can simply install with pip just search try searching how to install the turtle with pip and everything is over just a one line one command you can do it just install turtle and you can read more about turtle from here the documentation provided by the turtle library you can see a lot of functions at their lot of functionality they have given let of examples are there you can use the examples to, understand how you can create animation through turtle actually it is used to create patterns and that’s what exactly what we are doing what we show what we showed during the first video so let’s see this so in order to start with, will first create a simple turtle program to show you how it works so let’s see this. First have to import the turtle library so that import turtle that’s it ok after that I have to create a turtle a turtle is a kind of pen which works on the canvas so for that I will create a variable tur lets say and I will create my canvas turtle dot turtle so my turtle has been created now I want to create a simple square box so for that I will write a loop for I in range five I will forward this pen tur turn which I am saying is the pen on my canvas at some pre define starting position so I will just forward it tur dot forward function is there with, with fifty units ok and then after it got provided with fifty units I will turn this pen position within angle of ninety degree so for that I have to use the function dot write it always take the parameter as an angle so I have to take give ninety which means it will turn it with ninety degree and do all this thing again ok that’s it I am done with this I have to write turtle dot done great, let me run this. Cool I got my square see, its working perfectly ok let’s do something else let me create a loop of let’s just say fifteen stances and I will change the angle with let’s say one forty four degree let’s see what happens. Something is wrong let me run this again ok see this, see I created a star so you can using this you can create a lot of beautiful patterns with different colours ok great so we are going to use this library to create our pattern which is spiral traversing and animation depth we saw in the first video we are going to create exactly the same animation with this turtle library. Thank you
SPIRAL TRAVERSING – LET’S ANIMATE 06
Hello everyone, in last video we saw how we can use basic turtle I mean we can use the turtle library to create basic programs basic pattern programs and basic animations will use this in our will use the turtle in our last program that we did for the spiral traversing to create the pattern that is creating the animation where there were dots printed in spiral order so this is the program which, which I created which I created before traversing the matrix in spiral order, will use this programme to create the animation so let me first import the turtle, import turtle by default whenever a turtle is created the canvas which is created has a default white value the background colour is white I am going to need a background colour of black so I will create a canvas of black background for that turtle dot bg colour that is black ok now I will create a turtle name Seurat to create I have to write turtle dot turtle I created a turtle, whenever I am going to traverse towards the matrix I am going to print a dot for that I need a circle kind of thing so for that I need a width variable I will create a width variable of size let say five and a height variable of size seven and whenever I go to a particular element I will print this thought and I will move forward with some distance so I need that distance so I will write the distance at dot underscore distance which is let’s say twenty five ok create, now I created this turtle but I need a initial position for where it should start for that I will set the initial position is dot set position to minus two fifty comma two fifty you can change the position according to your program but I am keeping it minus two fifty comma two fifty it actually starts centre all with always starts from centre so if you put zero comma zero it the position of the turtle will be at the centre of the canvas but I need it at the left most top most left corner so for that I am keeping it the x coordinate as minus two fifty and y coordinate as two fifty while I see this I need the colour of the dot as white because my background is black so for that I will write dot colour which is white great now inside my while loop I will go ok whenever I print first row after printing the first row my after going through the first row my turtle position should be at angle of ninety degrees should move at the angle of ninety degrees so that it can go downwards so in order to go downwards I have to put it downwards I have to put the position of turtle I have to move the position of the turtle within the angle of ninety degree but it should be it should print as the first row as, as usual I mean it should go forward in the right direction it should not print in downward direction from the first row only so from that I will create a variable to check that lets say flag of f as zero ok after printing this ok so I will check here if f is equal equal to one it means I already printed the first row I will move the position of I mean that direction of a turtle at the angle of ninety degree to the right ok and here after printing the first row now I don’t need to print the array here just command it and instead of this I will write here ok dot forward with distance which I put as the variable dot distance ok and after I print the first row I need to set my flag value which means if this is ok and after this you always have to turn the position of the turtle at the angle of ninety degree to the right side that’s why I created this flag value of the left ok done so first row is over after the first row ok I print the elements of the row I have to print the column I mean in the first iteration I was printing the last all the elements of last column so I have to print in the downwards way for that I have to change the angle of my turtle to
 
downwards it means to the right of ninety degree that is dot right I put ninety degree again here I don’t need to print the elements I will just command it and I will write my turtle I will forward my turtle to dot distance, after this again I have to change the direction of my turtle to the ninety degree for that dot right ninety that’s it this is also printing I don’t need this so I will just command it and instead of printing the element I will just forward my turtle forward with dot distance again same thing after printing the last row I mean the row in reverse order I have to again change the direction so I will do this right ninety here again I will not print this I will forward let me copy this and forward it, distance ok great so now I don’t need all of these arrays because I am not printing any of the array nor I need this count value ok I just have to call this let me change the parameters here this is ok let me do this for the value twenty rows and twenty columns ok I am done so I will write turtle dot done lets run this, cool. See I created my spiral traversing so I am getting lines ok this is all what we have to do now little after little tuning up we get created what we get created in the first video what we saw in the first video so this is exactly what you wanted to do you can, you can take this program change whatever order you want to change this is the main program actually, you can fill the colours, you can change the shape you can you can do something else ok but this is the main program ok thank you.
SPIRAL TRAVERSING – LET’S ANIMATE 07
So in this program what I was doing, I was doing two things first I created a list of colours let me zoom it ok so first I created a list of colours a list colour white, yellow, brown, red, blue, green, orange, pink. Violet, grey, cyan you can give lot of colours you can check the top line, second what I was doing rather than printing the line if you just forward the, the position of the turtle it will just print a line, you can create a dot also so there is a function in order to create a dot which is known as turtle name dot dot and it will create the dot with, with the way you want to create it ok so it will create a small dot the colour we the colour we want to create so in this I am at random on the random basis I am writing different colours ok so that’s that I am doing here and for that first you have to remove your lining pen not to remove lining pen you have to write a call off function which is known as penup which will penup means that it will not it will not create a simple line rather than when I will call the function dot function it will create a dot and go forward at the time of forwarding it will not print anything so penup will not after putting penup it will not print anything whenever you print when will you call a dot function it will print a dot there and move forward that’s it, that’s what I was doing exactly there so and every time what I was doing I was calling a random function so you can see here call randint from zero to ten, zero to ten means within these, these our spoiling colour from this list and using that colour every time so that the colour changes randomly, this is the pronoun for the pattern, it is the same pronoun which we which we which we wrote in the last video only little bit tunes up so you can create your own program you can change this so I will recommend you guys to please change the program and create your own pattern using this parallel order only you can different things also you can one more thing you can do is you can rather than going from the first element which is present at zero comma zero and going to the middle element you can start from the middle element and you go you can go in the reverse parallel order to the first element. So this program hopes like this so yeah it will show a spiral order like this with dot, you can even create some other shapes rather than dot you can see the turtle documentation you can create different shapes actually, you can create your own shape also and I am not doing anything I am just randomly changing the colours by picking up the random colour form the list of random colours which are defined as a variable and I just put it on the same program which I wrote in the last video so that’s it so why to do this? Because it’s just fun that’s it nothing else so please post your questions and whatever problems you are facing in this regarding this video in the discussion form, we would like to help you guys to do this program, to learn interactive programming with python and please if you please I would like you guys to change this program to make something else, if you have some new ideas please please post it on discussion form. Thank you.
GPS - TRACK THE ROUTE
Hey guys, suppose I asked you to go to a remote place in your city so what would be the first thing that will come to your mind? Off course that would be gps, so our next choice is about gps.
GPS: TRACK THE ROUTE 01
Hello friends, welcome to yet another joy in our course or you must be aware of gps the global positioning system it is something it will let you share your location on whatsapp or track your route using goggle maps. Gps is actually a network of satellites that help tracking the geographical locations of an individual, keeping the technical stuff aside let me give you a nice motivation about this joy. Assuming this story some time back one of my friends owning a pizza delivery company calls me, he has complaints of late deliveries from is customers and he installs a gps tracker on the delivery bikes hoping that this would solve his problems but instead of giving the location name gps tracker gives raw information in the form of latitude and longitude information in order to help my friend I need to write a code that helps him track the route of his delivery boys but can we do it using python? Of course yes, but how can we do it? Well we have amit to our rescue, let’s find out.
GPS - TRACK THE ROUTE 02
HI guys, in this video we will see given a set of routes how we can plot the route on Google maps so for this we are going to use two languages these are gm plot and csv library what you have to do exactly, what’s the problem? Let me explain. So you are given a set of plots ok and is you have to plot these routes on Google map so how you can do this? So suppose this is my file named as route dot csv and these are the coordinates, coordinates means the first number which is shown near latitude second number is shown in the longitude so it is separated by a comma so that’s why this file name is route dot csv, csv means dot csv file format is comma separated by this so whatever the values are there separated by comma you can open these file in spread sheet also or in any simple text editor so we will recommend you guys to use blind text or you can use any simple text editor so suppose I have list of coordinated here so in the video you saw that there is a guy and he was wondering around on bicycle and the manager what he did, he put a gps system in his bike so that he can he can see the routes where he is going and whether he is delivering in the correct location or not or he is wondering off any where so suppose he get the information in this file dot csv file and these are the locations where he were where the person went know how to plot this because these number doesn’t make me sense I don’t know what to do with this I don’t know where he went exactly so there is a way we can plot this so in this video we will see how we can plot this on Google maps and how we can see what the routes are been followed by this values so let’s tuned on and let’s see in next video.
GPS: TRACK THE ROUTE 03
Before we start plotting the routes let me go through this route dot csv file one more time and will see how we can pass this file using our csv library that I said in the last video, you know this route dot csv file has well need the coordinates in separated by commas it mean that first value is the latitude value and the second value separated by comma is the longitude value. The first step is to pass this data how to how to extract this information from this file in python? So let’s see this. So I will create a new, new python file name gps dot py and I will import this csv library, you can read more about csv library on goggle, there is a nice documentation here you can read all the functions and the data provided by the library please have a look at it and I will be using very simple passing method to pass the csv file so let’s see this. I will import the library first import csv ok, now my csv file name which I want to pass the name of the file is route dot csv so I will open that file with open route in commas route dot csv in green board because I don’t have to write anything as f would say you can put here an variable name here ok after opening it I will use a radio function so I will create a variable name reader and I will use the csv reader function to pass this f, what what! What it does, it will create a iterator through this file ok so that I can iterate over it and I can read the values one by one as the list so, so now my reader variables has on the, on the data of the csv file I have been iterative so I can iterate over it so what will you do? I will iterate over it using the loop for let’s say row in reader ok now row will give me row will contain list so each item of this list will be a value separated by comma so first will be the first value and second will be the second value after the comma third will be the third value after the comma like this in string so let me print this so what I will do? I will store the first value in lat that is equal to row of zero ok because zeroth element of this list contain the first value and long is equal to row of one because the first elements contains the second value that is the longitude I just print it print lat print long or I will just create a dummy print so that I get a new line character that’s it let me run this, cool! so you can see all the latitude longitude values has been extracted and printed ok so suppose what I do I will try to sum up, let me print the some of the latitude longitude just in some so what I will do here in the last print statement I will print lat plus long ok it should print me the sum of this values so let me run this cool so you can see the sum of latitude longitude ok so here is the problem it’s not exactly the sum what you are getting is a concatenation of two strings so as I said this, these are not the float values these are string values so what are you getting is the concatenation of the string values because the plus what in python if you do a plus in two strings it will concatenate the strings you are getting a concatenated value so in order to get the sum of this latitude longitude you have to change it you have to type cast that is we say type casting in c so it means you just change the string value into float value so for that you just need a function float and inside this so what it will do it will just change the string value into float now let’s run this now if I run this now you can see I am getting this sum one not six point three four zero seven so now I know how to pass it a simple passing a head of this csv file this is all required for this for program. In next video you will see how, how to plot this latitude and longitude value.
GPS – TRACK THE ROUTE 04
So now we know how to pass the csv file or using our csv library plot this on Google map for this we need a different library name as gm plot so let me just import this gm plot here to see that whether it is present on this anaconda cloud or not so I will put from gm plot import gm plot let’s see, you can see that it’s written that error module not found error no module named gmplot means that this module is not present in the anaconda cloud it might happen that you looking for some new module which is not on anaconda most of the time all the modules and libraries are present in the anaconda that’s why we recommended anaconda but there some library some new libraries which are still pending and which are not present on anaconda cloud but you can download it. One thing is that you can list all the libraries which are present on the anaconda, to do that you can just type on your terminal conda list will list all the libraries which are downloaded by the conda which are present on the conda cloud so you can see all these libraries which are present in your conda cloud ok, you can see that gmplot is not there so I am going to download it, in order to download anything from conda you can search each search it through conda the command is conda search gmplot, now it will search this gmplot named conda cloud in its cloud whether it is present in any of its channel if it is present then it will download, it might happen that may the library which we are looking for may not be present you can see that package not found error thrown from conda this library is not present in any of these channels in that case you have you can download the package through pip, so I will download pip install gmplot, now pip will install this gmplot and it will it will be automatically taken by the anaconda. Ok it says that successfully installed gmplot one point two point 0 so I will see this, let me try this command again you can see that it has been imported so it means that I can use this library now ok great let me delete this ok so I will import my csv library import csv next I will import this gmplot from gmplot import gmplot ok before I go any further you can read more about gmplot on you can Google it you can read more about gmplot on get there is a get on library on gmplot on the radio material is diploitation is provided how to place the map? How to create polygon? How to create the marker and how to draw it, how to see it, all these things are present depend in this look. Ok so let’s see this. So I will import the csv file, csv library and gmplot library next what I will do I will place mine map on a particular location for that there is a function so let me create a variable gmap is equal to, you can see here also that how to place your map to particular coordinate to a location if you want to place the map to a particular location you need to write the latitude longitude value of that location and you can use the Google map plotter functional gmplot see you have to put the latitude longitude and the zoom resolution here the exactly same thing I am going to do here gmplot dot Google map plotter ok and you can see when I show the argument centre latitude, center longitude and zoom here I will put my location as twenty eight dot six eight nine one six nine this is one random location I put or you can change it accordingly whatever you want to put there three two triple four eight and let the zoom resolution will be seventeen so I will the gamp contains the map location where I want to plot the, second thing is I want to create the icon, the icon which I am going to use to plot my routes so I can just you just copy this line here ok you do not have to carry much,
 
you can create your own icon here but I am going to use this Google icon you can just copy this line and you will get the icon ok I have the icon I have the map now I will read the I will pass my csv file so that I can plot I know how to pass it with open I will open my route dot csv file dot csv ok as f I will create my reader iterator using the csv dot reader function I will pass my file. Let me create a variable name k using this k how will I use this? So let me pass this reader iterator, iterate through it for row in reader ok so row will give me list of all the values which are present in this csv file so I need to there are two values latitude and longitude ok and store it in latitude and longitude, so lat is equal to row zero since this is a string value I need to have the float value I will convert it into float same thing which we did in the last video the same I will store the longitude value is float of row awesome! Have the latitude and longitude values float values now I am going to use the ‘k’ as a dummy variable how, if k is equal is equal to zero it means the first time this is the first coordinator I left then what I will do gmap dot I will use the marker, marker function I put the marker function put the marker to a particular latitude to particular coordinate that latitude longitude, put the marker at this lat and long value which this is the first lat and long value with colour, so let me put the colours yellow ok and I will make a ‘k’ is equal to one which means that this was the first and after this whatever is coming you can do something else if you want so else if it is not the first coordinate which means the ‘k’ is also ‘k’ value is not zero means first value is already ‘k’ and you already put yellow mark at there so whatever is coming after the first is you can you create the I am creating the marker as particular latitude and long with colour blue ok this is done since the last latitude longitude value the lat and long at the last after this iteration will contain the last latitude longitude value again I would like to place a read marker there what I will do put a gmap dot marker lat long of colour red that’s it, at the last location I will put red colour marker so we are done I just have to draw this map gmap dot draw with html file that’s in my may dot html do it, I am going to run this ok so I created a my map dot html so let me see go to my folder it say let me open this with my chrome and you can see so this is since it is yellow it is starting from which means this is the first location ok this is the first location only that delivery guy started and then went till this particular streets when some where some where these are the blue coordinates given by the gps device and he going somewhere and you can see these are the locations he went these are the blue locations there there these are the red location this is the last location. So this is how you can easily plot the coordinate if you have the coordinated you can plot it on Google map using the python it’s very easy though I didn’t use any hard core programming there many libraries through which you can do simple things that’s why python is so popular you can do a lot of things with few lines of code because there are lots of library and the community is very strong. So thank you very much
