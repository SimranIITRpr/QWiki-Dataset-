TUPLES: PYTHON DATA STRUCTURE
Hello guys, welcome to programming screen cast, in this programming screen cast we would be seeing about a data structure that python offers you, please don’t get terrified by the term data structure it is nothing it’s just way which you can arrange your data. That is what you call as data structure in simple terms so python offers a lot of data structures we had seen some of them in the previous weeks we had seen list you have been extensively using lists and you will be also using in future and dictionaries we had seen you had dictionaries in rock, paper, scissors game I guess so will see yet another data structure call the tuples. So the data structure name is tuple, maybe I guess now you can see it the font size I have increased the data structure name is tuple, we call it as a tuple so what is basically a tuple will see right? So initially we will start with creating a tuple, how can we create a tuple? So let me say I want to store the ice cream flavours which I like let us say ice cream flavours let me say, ice cream flavours equal to it’s a name of my tuple that’s a variable name so I will say to create a tuple what you need to use is the normal paralysis the normal brackets open and close bracket so within this you need to give the items of the tuple, one maybe I can say vanilla then I can say chocolate then butterscotch then strawberry maybe I will say strawberry and so on you can give any number of flavours so alright so let me press enter alright my tuple got created now if I say ice cream flavours see I got this tuple vanilla, chocolate, butterscotch, strawberry whatever I had added so you can use this way or you can print as how had been using print ice cream flavours I think I was just pressing the tab key because of which it got auto fill and please note that I am using the console I am explain using the console if you feel that the screen doesn’t appear familiar just that I have maximised the console that’s it I will press enter see I got it as a tuple ok so what if I want to print it one by one, how can I do that? Simple just like how you use loops in lists or dictionaries something like that say something like that you can use loop ok let us see how we can print the elements one by one simple just like how you have some you have used loops in lists or dictionaries previous data structure whatever data structures you had seen you can use a loop to print each element individually as you wish so let me use a for loop for I will say flavours flavour in ice cream flavours that is my variable name start my loop I will say print sorry its print I have to say flavour so I have used an intuitive name you can use any variable name here for I j anything you can use even though this is tuple of ice cream flavours I am using a variable name flavour we got it one by one vanilla, chocolate, butterscotch, strawberry alright so we had printed the elements in the tuple and now in case if you want to access the individual elements how would you do? That is I just want to print chocolate let us say how would you do? Let us see chocolate is the second element in my list just like in my tuple so let just like how I did in my list I will use the index indexing mechanism so let me say print what is this tuple name ice cream flavours of the index I have to give its my second thing so let me give two letters see what happens butterscotch see the third one gets printed so if I say two the third one in the list got printed so what does that mean? So the indexing mechanism the python uses is different so that is it starts counting differently its starts counting from zero just as how it did in list you should start counting from zero this is index zero vanilla is at index zero chocolate is at index one butterscotch is at index two strawberry is at index three this is how it counts we start counting from one and but the computer starts counting from zero so if he want the second item we
 
should give index one then we can get the second item as per our view, as per our perceptivity second item but for computer first item that is because its start counting form zero so let us print it print ice cream flavours of one so that is the second item actually if I print see I got chocolate which is the second one actually in the list alright so this is how you access an item simple nothing but you give the name of the tuple ice cream flavours you use this square brackets and give the index at which you are decided item is present say let me say three strawberry got printed let me say I will let it be a typo I will say thirty see tuple index out of range it throws an error in case such an item that is index number thirty I have instead of printing three let in case I printed I typed as thirty that a typo error given that there is no index thirty in the list it says index out of range that is there is a range of the index value for this tuple that is zero one two three these are the allowed values this thirty is out of this range is what the error means so it throws an error right so let us see we have let us just summarise very quickly. We had created a tuple ice cream flavours and we had access the individual element to create a tuple what you did? You just used the open parenthesis and you just inserted the item and you had just access the elements so in case I want to change something for example I don’t want to have butterscotch instead I would like to add black current flavour so I want to modify the element or I want to add something newly so how would I do that? Let me see let me say tuple name is ice cream flavours just as how you did in lists the update functionality let us try the same way because we are accessing the elements in a similar way as that of the list using indexes so let us try updating as well the same fashion as that in list so let us see ice cream flavours of it was in index two right butterscotch so let me remove that and I want to make it as black current black current clack current I made it as I don’t need an underscore here is a string so basically ok black current so let me press enter see its throwing an error tuple object does not support item assignment its telling something ok let me try adding it as new item so it was having zero one two three right I want to add it at index four I will say index four is black current here I am trying to add it initially I tried modifying it was not allowing me for what so ever reasons let me try adding it the same error is being thrown again probably I have to delete that initial value and again reassign the value probably that is how tuples work let me experiment let me say delete the same key word that we used in dictionaries delete del ice cream flavours of two let me say tuple object doesn’t support item deletion oh even this doesn’t work so let me ask for help delete question mark that will give me a hint delete not found what happened? Omg! Delete ice cream flavours let me check let me ask for help tuple empty the tuple if I ask for a question it says it will empty the tuple it says I cannot delete an individual item I cannot modify an item I cannot add an item I cannot delete and individual item all that I can do is I can delete the tuple completely I can delete the entire tuple so basically tuples are sort of data structures which is fixed once of you fix something it remains as that as like that forever that is what they technically call as immutable so those who have some knowledge of biology you would have heard term called mutation that is nothing but some changes in your genes that is what they call as mutation so the same terminology they have been using here as well we call tuples are immutable because you cannot make changes as like you had made in list or dictionaries if you use a tuples so tuples once if you fix something it is fixed forever now if I say delete ice cream flavours the entire tuple would get deleted so let me check if I now call ice cream flavours and I call it says name ‘ice cream flavours’ is not defined so what are the

options that is supported is you can create a tuple, you can access the elements of a tuple and you can delete it as a whole you cannot add anything modify anything delete a single item nothing of sort can be done so it is sort of a foxed data structure alright it seems very restrictive right so is there any other option? Is there any other thing that can be done in tuple so let me create a toy tuple for example create a toy tuple let me just use some numbers one two three four given that I have deleted that ice cream flavours tuple so I am just creating another tuple for demonstrating what else can be done so just like the length functionality of the list can be used I will demonstrate length of toy will say four so the length functionality can be used in case I want to see the count I can use the count functionality as well as if you want to retrieve the specific index where the element position is where the particular element is present you can see that toy dot count I want to count the number of times then number two occurs it occurs one time so it says two the toy of count is one let me change the tuple once for you let me making it as one two, three ,four, five, one, two, three, four, one two, three, four, five so I had made a new tuple basically see initially I had toy is equal to one two three four and here I have this you can ask me you said tuples are immutable you cannot change them but how can you change this, so what happens is that thing what I had created already this gets destroyed and something new gets created that’s what happens so you, if you changing or if you try modifying in this way the old one get destroyed so whatever you once seek that would remain fixed you cannot change it alright so let me show that for you, length of toy initially it was four now if I say it’s says nine so the earlier copy was completely destroyed so now I can show you the functionality count toy dot count let me say how many number of times the number two occurs, it occurs two times number four occurs two times number five once so count is the function that is how many number of times this particular item is occurring in the tuple so in a tuple you can give numbers initially in ice cream favour example we gave strings you can give it anything even the floating point value you can give anything we will see some applications where the different types of values are given in tuples so count is one functionality and other functionality you can have is index so let me say toy dot index of five let me say five is present at index eight and if you say, say for example two it is present at index one it says but see two was present at two places so the index functionality returns the very first index from the left where the particular item is present, that is what the index functionality does, so these are some functionality that you can list, length, count index that can be used in tuples also but something you can do in list which cannot do in tuple is you are modifying an element, adding a new element or deleting the particular element those things are not allowed so tuples are sort of once you defined its fixed so such a restricted data structure where can it be used. I had post the question and probably you would have thought the same I guess so why do they even create this? Is it even useful? Of course yes it is used in many cases once such example I wills say, say for example you are dealing with rainbow, rainbow is a tuple you can say the colours in rainbow violet, vibgyor right! Indigo, blue, green, yellow, orange, red so once you have defined this as the rainbow no one can further add or delete or undo anything about this so this is we want to the rainbow consist of these seven colours its fixed so that you don’t want anyone to make any changes in such scenario you can make use of tuples, in one scenario where this would be useful this rainbow even is a toy example you can consider as I just showed you to illustrate something that it is fixed in the nature you cannot change no now can change this for such scenario you can use

tuples for one thing where in computer science they use tuples is in you can say in image processing so in images the each individual unit of an image is called as a pixel this is basically like human body contains cells, cell is the basic unit of the human body something like that, the basic unit of the image is called a pixel so each pixel, if you would as you would have studied in your school physics each colour can be represented in terms of the three basic colours namely red green and blue every colour any colour can be represented in terms of this that is by proportions of red green and blue by taking ten percent red forty percent blue and the rest green something like that by some proportions of red green and blue you can denote any colour so every pixel will have a colour in an image so in case if that is a image of a grass or some natural grass the top portion will be the sky it will have the blue value which will have dominant and the bottom portion will be the grass which will have the green value dominant in case you have sand there will be yellow it will be represented in terms of some proportions of red green and blue as you can see every pixel has variation in colours each colour can be represented in proportions of red green and blue so basically a pixel probably would be defined like this pixel one there maybe millions of pixels in an image depends on your camera resolutions where you would have seen that five mp camera, eight mp camera, thirteen mp camera you heard these days right, there may be different pixels it depends on the camera resolution as there are number of pixels increases the clarity of the image also increases so the pixel one contains some colour say yellow colour so it may be something like point seven sorry its zero point seven comma zero point one comma zero point two something like that some proportions of red green and blue rgb is the order in which they will represent the pixels so in that case they internally represent each pixels in terms of tuples so you don’t want to change this that is this should be the proportion in this image you don’t want to change it that time they will say this is the particular pixel configuration that is this is the colour that is associated with this pixel so in such applications in computer science tuples come very handy alright you can think of many such applications where once you fix something you don’t want to change it in such a scenario if you encounter some such scenario you can consider using this data structures tuples alright guys thanks for watching the programming screen cast have a nice day.
LOTTERY SIMULATION: PROFIT OR LOSS
Have you ever tried your luck in gambling? Well, you shouldn’t let us find out in our next joy named lottery simulation.
LOTTERY SIMULATION: PROFIT OR LOSS 01
What’s the matter? You look worried, yeah I have to share something with you. Ok I have this brother of mine who gambles a whole lot and I have tried convincing him several times not to do I mean not to continue in that path but he never listens to me and he feels he is earning the whole lot of them but I force him that he lose everything one day that is really bothering me. So what kind of gambling is that? Ok, let me explain and that is a system of ten units and he bets on one unit if he wins then he will get the all nine units but if he loses then its, its little less but that is you invest hundred rupees, yes and if you win you get nine hundred if you lose you lose the hundred rupees, yeah precisely actually deceptive yeah you feel as though you can make a lot of money yeah that’s why he is feeling he is not loosing but I force that he is, you tried counselling him? Yeah I tried several times I have told them but he never gives an ear to it, ok. So what else can be done? That’s what I am thinking I tried to see I am trying to seek your help for it, can is it possible that we can simulate this through a computer? Ok so you want to see whether, whether you can simulate the process of wining or loosing yeah in a game of gambling yeah and you want to see whether one can become rich or one undergo very losses, yes precisely I you see he is educated so if you help me with this I can assure to him that see you are not in the right path and this is what actually happening, I think this is possible but this is popularly called the gamblers rule in problem probability but that aside you want to see if we can simulate the enter process of gambling and try to figure out if someone can even win or not, of course we will win a few times, we will lose a lot of times let’s say we play here for one year’s time three sixty five days we would like to see whether we make a lot of money or not right? yes very good so what I will do, I will try to help you out with the simulation I will even give you the plots, ok on what happens if you keep playing for the next few days, months, years ok and the inference is starling enough to make your educated brother stop gambling yeah let’s try our best though I cannot guarantee that he will stop gambling because gambling is a disease its very tough to people to come out of it but with proper counselling and making people understand the math behind it they might get convince that they will go back upraise oh! If you do that with the computer I will be really grateful should be possible let’s try, I cannot guarantee you but I can tell you that once can be hopeful because with proper counselling you can ensure that you can make any educated person understand gambling don’t work.
LOTTERY SIMULATION: PROFIT OR LOSS 02
Hello guys, welcome to programming screen cast of lottery stimulation so let me first introduce that is lottery simulation let me just give you a brief overview, I hope you have seen previous video where the procedure of lottery simulation lottery was explained, I will just give a brief overview so basically there are some sort of coupons was available and you have to bet on one particular coupon and there draw coupon randomly from the available list of coupon and if your betted coupon and the coupon that appears matches you will win for playing this game you are supposed to place some amount and if you win you get something much more than what you have paid, so this is how they try to tempt you to play the lottery so let me explain it, let me take a very quick scenario and explain it so let me assume that there are some ten coupons so basically each coupon contain a digit a number from one to ten so one two three like that up to ten, one number is present in each coupon like that there are coupons that coupon contains the digits from one to ten you are supposed to bet something say I say the number seven will appear if you draw now I will say that so now after listening to my bet seven they will draw coupon randomly, if that randomly drawn coupon contains the number seven I win otherwise I lose, to play this game I have to pay say some hundred rupees if I win that if I get lucky and I got the same number if I win I will get say thousand rupees ten folds see I am getting back ten folds or even if you say nine hundred rupees anything I am getting much more than what I am paying so I am really tempted to play this game so let us see what happens if I play this game, if I get lucky I will get much more than what I paid, if I get unlucky I will lose hundred rupees which is not very big deal, let us try what happens let us try simulating it so to simulate this we will use something called random so because you are randomly picking one coupon out of the available coupons right so we are I am going to use package called random so let us say I will say import random I hope you are you have used this package sometime so basically to deal with something that happens with some probabilistic thing randomness we use this package random so I will I will so say I have a bet so bet is something I have a number so let me say I have to get the input of the bet, the bet is the number I have to get a input, input as you know would generally take everything in terms of strings so I have to type cast it I have to change it into integer type so let me do that int of input so I have to ask for what is your bet? So I will say your bet ok so I got the bet from the user, once I have got the bet now I have to stimulate the lucky draw, let me say lucky draw so what is this lucky draw? I will take a coupon randomly it will contain a number from one to ten so to stimulate that I will use the function from random package it is random dot randint what is this functionality done? What is this do? You are supposed to pass two parameters ‘a’ and ‘b’ as it is shown so a number form a to b between that in that range some number will be there so I want from one to ten so one to ten here both one and ten both the end points are also included any number can be picked from one two three four five six seven eight nine ten, one of these ten numbers could be picked even I have to bet something from one to ten so let me make this statement more clear, your bet from one to ten let me make this more clearer so I have inputted a value I have asked for what is my bet as you could see here I have asked for his betting so let me find so I have inputted what is the number on which I want to bet and now I am stimulating this lucky draw so here I will be getting another number and if so for that before that I need to have something called the
 
account right? Where do I deposit the money that I am winning so let me say I have some account initially there is nothing I got it from the organisers of the game so it is zero and now if I get lucky that is my betted number as well as the one I got in the lucky dry they both turn out to be equal so this double equal to symbol is what I am using it for equality check if you use a single equal to it is assignment so it will change the value sign but I want to check the equality I don’t want to change the values so I am using the double equal to symbol that is equal to the lucky draw then to my accounts what happens? Whatever was there earlier along with that amount say nine hundred rupees gets added and to play this game how much have I spent? Hundred rupees so I have to deduct hundred because I have spent hundred from my hand and I have added some nine hundred rupees because I have won in this place so nine hundred got added and I had spent hundred rupees so the net gain is eight hundred rupees I am getting into my account if I get lucky what if I didn’t get lucky? Nothing I just lose my hundred rupees else if I didn’t get lucky else what happens I will lose hundred rupees so let me say account is nothing but I have to deduct hundred from my previous earnings from those earnings I am spending so I have to deduct it ok so at the end of the game what is there in my account and print ok see I just playing once here I get an input I bet on some number and some lucky draw happens, some number is drawn at random and if that is equal to what I have bet I win nine hundred rupees else I don’t win anything but to play this game I have to pay hundred rupees that is why I am deducting hundred in both the cases so at the end of the game what is that I will have in my account that is after playing this game what do I have, let us see that now let me save this and now let me maximise the console so here is where you get the output right so let me maximise this portion and now let me run this run, run it ok your bet from one to ten it is asking me let me say I bet on seven minus hundred see so I had lost why have I lost actually? I don’t know, I want to see what happened in my lucky draw case so let me print it and modify this programs slightly let me print the lucky draw print the lucky draw whatever is the value in lucky draw I want to print it as well as whatever is in my account I will print it let me save the program and now let me maximise this portion maximise here and now let me run it again its asking me for a bet so let me now bet on five it turned out to be four and so I lose ok let me try again I run again this time let me bet on two it turned out to be ten again I lose I am losing continuously ok it’s all luck so let me try simulating this multiple times and see what happens, let us see this in the next video.
LOTTERY SIMULATION: PROFIT OR LOSS 03
Hello guys, in the last video you had seen what happens when you try betting on what would appear as a result of a lottery draw we got a lot of losses but we has just run only once right what if we play multiple times there is a possibility that we get lucky and we win a lot of price let us see that so let me assume in the first go if I play this game for one week and here if you see one week is seven days so seven times I have to get the input its slightly time consuming and also irritating on the users and if you think seven times you are entering the input so let me simulate this is just the simulation right so this is we need not accurately do what we do in the real world so let us make it even this as a random integer that is how we have a lucky draw something like that we will have a random pick let me copy this and use the same thing here for betting thing also because every time while giving the input I didn’t have anything in my mind so I was just randomly giving some input right so let why do I want to get the input, let me pick something randomly so let me pick random so I will use the same thing so see bet I have random integer and I lucky draw I have something so now I have to print it very clearly initially I just had lucky draw as a random, randomly pick numbers so I had just printed the value but now given that both the values are randomly pick I have to print it properly so let me print it let me say this is my bet turned out to be bet turned out to be this value that is stored in the variable bet and now the lucky draw lucky draw this turned out to be the value stored in this variable lucky underscore draw ok so I will print this too and my account has zero and every time I will check it I will see if my bet and the lucky draw is equivalent if it is equal I win a lot of price otherwise I lose so let me here even here I have to say amount in your account let me say amount in your game account game account is nothing but it is stored in the variable account may be let me maximise this part so that it’s very clear ok so I have modified slightly if you could see I will just summarise the modifications so bet I am just choosing random integer which is my bet which is simulating my bet and this is another random integer which simulates the lucky draw that is whatever the organiser is picking from the collections of coupons that is the lucky draw and I will print the values whatever has been randomly picked then I have my account initially it is zero but as you keep playing see because we have to repeat this thing as I have said let us see what happens if we play this game for a week so we have to repeat this thing so if I put zero here account equal to zero here every time account will be initialised to zero and you cannot really see whether you actually win or lose so actually when I putted in the loop this must be out of the loop so let me cut this line from here cut and let me put it here initially my account has nothing the game account has nothing and I start my game here and I pick a bet and the organiser picks a lucky draw and if they are both are equivalent I will win some amount if not I don’t win any amount but since I am paying hundred rupees to play this game once I am subtracting hundred in both the cases and at the end of the game I will say this is the amount I have in my account currently so given the this is just seven times we are going to repeat it I said we are going to simulate it over a week alright so week has seven days so let me going to simulate it just for seven days seven times so I can print the amount at every instance but if we increase the number of iterations we may get messy that you print the amount at every instance so that time what you do, what is the final amount after those many number of games have been played we will just print the final one that’s it ok so I have to repeat this for some seven times
 
so let me use a far loop any loop can be used for is slightly convenient for us that’s why we are using it I in range seven because we want to repeat it seven times and see for loop requires indentation so let me select this entire block so I want this things to be indented so I have indented I have used a tap key I have indented everything so fine so I am repeating this seven times right so my programme is done I will just quickly summarise and we will run and see what happens so initially there is zero in my game account there is nothing in my game account I am doing this I am playing this game for seven days that is for a week I am playing this game each day what I do I bet for one number and the organiser will draw will draw a number randomly from his set of coupons that is what we call as a lucky draw, if my betting and the lucky draw that the organiser has taken if they both are equal I win a prize money if they both are equal I win a prize money otherwise I don’t win anything but to play this game I have to pay hundred rupees that is why I am deducting hundred from both the cases and after each game I am printing what is the amount in my game account so this is what the programming is doing I have saved it now let me maximise this portion value will get the output and let me run it run the file see we have got the output maybe I will maximise this pane that will be clearer so let me maximise this pane see initially the bet was three and lucky draw was six so I lost here so my account has minus hundred because I had paid hundred rupees initially and I didn’t win anything so I had minus hundred and see next time bet and my lucky draw is equal so I got lucky I got an amount next time I lost so some loss is there next time I had lost so again there is a loss again a loss again a loss again a loss you could see there are some more losses compare to gain but still due to the ratio of the amount we could see there is some profit net profit I have out of the game this is we have just simulated the playing of the game for one week let me just try running again so run again I am getting some amount oh I am getting still more amount I am having more wins again this time I am losing this time I am winning so wins and loss it’s all completely random right so anything can happen so this is I have simulated if I play the game for one week next we will see what happens if we play the game for one month we will see that in the next video.
LOTTERY SIMULATION: PROFIT OR LOSS 04
Alright guys, in the previous videos you had seen a simulation of lottery game if we play once and the next we saw if we play it for one week continuously now let us see if we play it for one months. On an average I take different months have different number of days on an average let me take thirty days, so for thirty days I am playing it, so just a simple change in place of seven I will make it thirty an thirty outputs it difficult to analyse so let me not print everything as I had done I hope you understood how things work the same thing it will work but given that the number of iteration the number of times we are repeating is increasing so output may look slightly messier so let me command these lines so I am commanding so I may need not print every time what happens I will just what I will do I will just print what is the amount at the end of the thirty times right? I don’t even want to print after every iterations so let me bring this out of the loop I will remove this indentation let me bring this out of the loops now this is out of the loop I have simulated this for thirty times I may win or I may lose something may happen but let me see what is the amount after I have played for thirty times that is after I have played for one month completely what is the amount whether I have a net profit or a net loss let us see so let me save the file now let me this is where you get your output right so let me let me maximise this and ok let me maximise this better and now let me run the file, amount in your account minus three hundred so here I have an net loss this time this month so if I repeat this time I won this time I have a huge loss compare to minus three hundred minus two thousand hundred is really huge loss now I won I won something but the winning is less I won I have a loss I have a loss there is lot of alteration of winning and losing then we cannot actually predict we win or loss but it seems the losses if we occur is we incur is very huge so let us try increasing the number of iterations that is we tried for one month right for thirty iterations let us try it for one year what happens if we play this game for one year and let us see that in the next video
LOTTERY SIMULATION: PROFIT OR LOSS 05
Alright guys, so till now you had seen the lottery simulation game for if we play this game for once, one week, one month we had seen now let us expand and let us see what happens if we play this game for one year. Nothing just a simple change in the program in place of thirty, thirty days in a month right so I play each day so I had simulated thirty, in place of thirty what if I play for one year so one year it may have three sixty five or three sixty six days depends on if it is a leap year or not let me consider the current year two thousand eighteen it’s a non leap year so it will have three sixty five days so I will put three sixty five you can even try for three sixty six I don’t think much change in result will be there just one iteration one more time you will play extra I don’t think much change in results will be there let us plot let us look at whether we could win or we losing let us see so let me maximise this pin now let me run the file oh it’s a heavy loss I am losing some twelve thousand rupees oh my god seven thousand rupees I am losing loss loss win loss loss thirty thousand still heavy loss loss loss win loss you could see I have more loss compare to win so if you keep playing for one year I was able to find there is more loss compare to win so I am having the net amount but still you have a idea that there is a loss but we want to visualise what happens so let us see the visualisation part in the next video.
LOTTERY SIMULATION: PROFIT OR LOSS 06
Alright guys, so you had seen what happens if you play this game lottery game for one year continuously so let us visualise what happens rather than seeing the net profit or a net loss let us visualise it. So let me say I will by visualisation I mean let us plot a graph basically graph with x-axis and y-axis, x-axis be on which day what do you win or what do you lose, on day one what is the amount you have on your account, on day two what is the amount you have in your account let us plot that and let us observe the trends so to plot will have a package that is amt plot lib I hope you had used the same package I guess it is in your crowd computing experiment the jelly beans experiment I had I hope you had used this package let’s just reuse the same package will import it, import matplotlib dot pyplot the name is very big and even that we need to use it lot of times difficult for us to type this big name so let us use a shorter name and alias name to use that you will have key word as you have to say as and use your shorter name so let me say plt so instead of telling matplotlib dot polyglot I will be telling plt this is an instruction this is what this means so I have imported it and now I need to plot it right so I need x-axis and y-axis so I need two lists ‘x’ denotes the ‘x’ axis quantity and let y denote the ‘y’ axis quantity so on being of each day I have to increase one value in my ‘x’ axis at day one day two day three something like that so at the beginning of the loop I will add that to my ‘x’ list ‘x’ dot append is the functionality to add some element into your list so what should I have? It is the first day means I have to add one second day two third day three something like that but you’re for loop is starts counting from zero that you want given that this is a visualisation for humans we need the counting to start from one so how can we tackle it just add one to it and append it so if I is zero I want one, I is one I want two so I basically want the values of I plus one let me append it I plus one ok so I have the day has started I bet something organiser draw something if it is equal I win some amount else I don’t win anything but to play this game given by that I am paying hundred rupees I am deducting hundred from each instance and after the game what should I do? I have to whatever the amount I have in my game account I have to append this to my ‘y’ axis that is I have to plot the corresponding thing in my ‘y’ axis so let me append that to the y axis list so that is y dot append I have to add it to the list the account, account has some amount right so let me say I have to append this value I have done that at the end of three sixty five days what will be there in this x list the corresponding day count day one day two day three up to day three sixty five and in y axis the list have whatever the amount your account contain the particular day that will be available and I want to plot it this is the net profit or net loss you have and after that you have to plot it so what should I say plt dot plot this is the function plot it I can say x and y I want to plot these two things and I want to show the plot so I will say plt dot show plt dot show so it will plot the values with taking the days in x axis we had set and the amount in y axis and it will generate a plot and show us the plot this is what these two lines are doing, let us observe visually what happens with these days let us save the program now let me maximise this side let me maximise the pane maximise the current pane and now let me run the file see so there are sometimes you have increase in your account sometimes you have a money but there is a huge fall if you could see, see this is really a very huge fall so you as you keep playing you encounter more a loss if you could see this if you analyse the fall is very huge so that is what makes it a that is why they say lottery don’t work ok this is
 
just once let us try again say see even here you could see there is a loss at the end loss and every time you just observe the y axis the amount positive values are very less negatives are very high especially observe this particular graph just zero to thousand is the maximum you had gain but loss some six thousand something some days you has even had such a heavy loss so that is why the take home message from this is lottery doesn’t work it amount they say you pay hundred if you win nine hundred nine times of what you pay this is a tempting statement but if you analyse the interfaces its not that you will win they are actually cheating you tempting you to lose a lot so it mostly the case that you will lose that is the take home message from this programming screen cast we had simulated and we had seen and for those who are interested the next avenue would be there is some probability involved here you could look into the map of it why is that happening? Why is that you lose a lot of time? So if you would analyse the probability of winning and probability of loosing you can get some insides for those who are interested you can check the math behind it why is it that most of the times we lose, I run once more this time I won I run once more this time there is a loss again loss, loss see there is a lot of loss and win I had run some probably six times just once I had won that is by one I say I have a net profit most of the times net profit or loss what I gain out of the game is a loss why this happens? You can Del deep into the probability aspects mathematical aspects that can be done as an extension to what you have learn in the programming screen cast this you had simulated and shown that it will be a loss why that happens that is being explained by the mathematical part, you can look into it alright guys thanks for watching this programming screen cast have a nice day.
IMAGE PROCESSING: ENHANCE YOUR IMAGES
What is the first thing that you do after clicking pictures? Of course apply filters in order to enhance them, so let us now shift gears and explore a new technique to enhance images through our next joy image processing.
IMAGE PROCESSING: ENHANCE YOUR IMAGES 01
We see CCTV’s and surveillance cameras almost everywhere these days so do you have any clue what exactly they do? They record a whole lot of photo frames and that becomes a video and they have to store all these video transactions across several days so storage can be a problem and hence the video quality is very very less, if you want if you want to store one weeks happenings in your hard disc then the quality will be very less, the quality is high you can only store one days worth transactions so the point is images captured by the surveillance cameras are generally very very low in quality so low that whenever there is a crime it might even be difficult for you to detect by surveillance cameras some of the minute details but you can indeed use your expertise in programming to take those video frames analysing video can be difficult so let us limit our discussion to photos so assume you capture a picture and the picture is of low quality so low that you have no clue what exactly are the minute details in the picture for example you are probably seeing me if you take a picture of mine you probably wouldn’t know what exactly is this symbol here on my shirt right? can you use programming to enhance an image so much so that the lesser details get enhanced and are visible as you can see such a enhancement would be a great use for forensic experts especially in a situations where there is crime and you have captured some pictures let’s say through surveillance cameras and the qualities very low. How do you enhance them? Let us see a couple of situations and let us tell you we are gonna tell you how exactly to enhance the images so much so that picture make much much better sense then what it did previously.
IMAGE PROCESSING: ENHANCE YOUR IMAGES 02
Hello all, welcome to programming screen cast of image processing let us explore some cool ideas in image processing through this screen cast before taking you to the programming part let me show you the images using which we are going to do image processing. This is the first image as you could see it looks like some mirror image all that we can make out from this image is just that some news paper clipping some photos have been pasted on the wall and what is written in the newspaper? It’s not so clear, this being mirror image it’s not so clear for person to understand what is being written here so let us apply some image processing technique, transform this image into a form that all can understand and let us try to see what is there. This is our first image for image processing that we are going to do now, next image is this, this image has been taken from a crime location as said in lectures then this whole exercise of image processing is ended helping find out the truth, this thing is image of bullet shot, a few bullet shots can be seen but there are many feature in this image which are not clear to us we will apply some image enhancement techniques image processing techniques some enhancement technique will enhance this image so that we shall understand about the minute features present in this image, who knows maybe that may serve as evidence let see ok not we start off with the programming component the first shown is the image of the mirror image that needs to be flipped so we can understand what is the written in those news paper clipping that has been pasted on to the wall let us see that so that exercise we are doing now the technique we are going to apply is flipping in some term it is flipping the image that is our first image processing task we are going to do, for doing this we need to downloads the necessary package let us do that we need the image package for pil library let me import that from pil import image, done importing alright I had shown you this image, this image is obtained dot png the name is obtain dot png lets open this image, it is done by this way image equals to image dot open here you are suppose to give the file path my image file is in the same directory as that of my python script so I am just giving the file name in case your image file is in different path you need to specify the entire path please note that the correct path has to be specified else if you just specify the name the file would be searched in the default directory where your script is running please note this point. File name is obtained dot png run with it we have opened this images this part is opening the image we are done with it images in general computers processes them in terms of matrices so that image is opened the corresponding matrix format is taken and capture by this object img the matrix format is capture here and flipping the image is the terminology that we are using here to actually convert the mirror image into actual image we are using the terminology for the thing that is easy on our minds but the technical terminology that they uses transposing as I said that images are generally transferred in terms of matrices so matrices I hope al would have come across them in your high school level mathematics in matrices there is some special operation called transposing that is nothing but your making your all rows as columns and columns as rows that is what you call it as transposing. So transposing operations your are going to apply to this matrix which will actually give you back your actual image from your mirror image that is what we are going to apply now. How
 
will we do that? Let’s see. this is our matrix object of the transposed image so let me call this transpose img this is nothing but image img dot transpose this is the pre defined function transpose of this is the pre defined parameter image dot flip left right this is the pre defied parameter what this line does is? It takes the matrix that is captured by img of object transposes that matrix and this new matrix is stored in transpose img object that object captures the new matrix so now we have got the actual image in the matrix representation that is understandable by the computers but now what we need to do is? We need to convert it into a form that is understandable by humans, let’s do that. The next step is we have to convert it into a human understandable format and save it to a file, to a file in a human understandable format that is the next step we need to do alright so this is done like this transposed image, you take the matrix object which you need to actually save it into human readable format to take this object and call save function on it this is also a pre defined function and it takes an argument here same like how you had done in open you are supposed to specify the path where you want your output file to be saved, here I want the file to be saved in the same directory so I just giving the desired file name. In case you want it to be saved in the different path please do specify the entire path correctly and give the desired file name let me give the desired file name. I will call this corrected because that was a mirror image which was not very clear to us this has been corrected so that it is clear to us now corrected dot png corrected dot png is the file format I want the same as input file format its fine with me so I have given that in case you need may be you can try changing the file format as you required jpg or dmp whatever you can give tat ok so now where everything is done just print a message this is for us to understand that the output file is ready just say that done flipping, done flipping ok everything is done let me run this file I have given command as well for each line of the code so in case you think that you need to understand the code please do pause the video, read through that understand the code then you may proceed with running of the file, let me run this file. Ok I got the output as done flipping let me check the output file I had named it as corrected dot png let me check it corrected dot png yeah I got this yeah this is the file see now it is clear from us to understand what is being written some news paper clipping doctor accused of killing wife something like this yeah some news paper clippings have been there so now I can understand what is being written here unlike the previous image which was not clear to us you can observe side by side this is not very clear this image is not very clear to us where as after applying the transposing operation we got an image that is very clear for us to understand what is being conveyed here so this is how transposing operation has helped us underwhelm something which is which was previously not clear and now that clear with the help of coding computing well among two operations that I have said one operation is done let us go with the second operation I don’t want this thing so let me command it I am done with the first operation so let me command that now the second operation is nothing but image enhancement there are many image enhancement techniques available we are going to use one special technique called as histogram equalisation specifically adaptive histogram equalisation we call it as clahe this is just the technical name all that you can take is that is an image enhancement technique we are going to use it so that I had shown you that image previously, yeah this is the image there are some features in this image which are not very clear to us that could be taken clearance we apply this technique enhance this image so that the portions that are not clearly visible will be clearly visible who

knows this is a image taken from this is the image of bullet shot this is taken from the crime location there maybe some features which may be evidences which open up new facts anything can be possible right! Let’s explore alright. For doing this we need to import our package cv2, cv2 is the package we need we have imported and now I need to same like that I need to read the image, image img equals to cv2 dot image read is the parameter I am supposed to give similar to the previous one suppose to give the file path here, since my image file path is there in the same directory I am just giving the file name in case your image file is in a different place you need to specify the path completely file name was crime dot png let me read this image, so image has been read so we are suppose to now apply the technique CLAHE image enhancement using clahe that is contrast limited adaptive histogram equalisation it is clahe in case you are interested to learn more about it there are so many good articles available online which reveal you everything right from the math underlying in the concept everything’s beautifully explained you can see it, here our aim is to arrival the mystery so we are not getting it into the technical part of it this can be looked up on any time it’s there are lot of resources available straight forward you can do it so let us apply the technique to our rescue to unravel new facts who knows anything may unravel let’s see. I have to first prepare for applying clahe technique, preparation for clahe this is the step that has to be done this is the equalisation technique histogram equalisation technique this is an enhancement technique to enhance the image some preparatory thing has to be done that is what I am doing now, I am creating an object that will how the properties of enhancement cv2 dot create clahe this is the preparatory face we are done with it now this enhancement technique works well if the images is in the black and white format all that we need is to unravel the facts so let us convert it to black and white formats get to know if there are some new facts and based on that if needed we can even convert it back to colour and we can do it that is our need basis we can do it anytime so let us convert it to nothing but a gray scale image so convert it into gray scale image this is the gray scale image we have to convert the image into the gray scale value so that this enhancement technique shall be really really effectively applied which converted gray image is equal to cv2 dot cvtcolour of to pass this image object then colour underscore BGR2GRAY this has been converted into a gray scale image cvt sorry cv this all these are pre defined functionality in cv2 package so just observe everything has been pre defined so it is with very few lines of code anyone can enhance any image unravel any facts from it this is so simple now a day’s ok we are done with making it into a gray scale image now let is ok we shall apply the enhancement process apply enhancement that is the next step we have to do enhanced image is clahe dot apply of gray scale image we are suppose to give the gray scale image to the CLAHE algorithm gray scale image has been passed and after enhancement all these as I have said image processing all this would be delt in terms of matrices img is an matrix corresponding to your original image that has been converted to gray scale and the corresponding matrix is captured by gray Img and that has been applied and some transformation would occur so the image is enhanced and this particular matrix is captured by e and h image that is enhanced image this is the short form I am using it this is captured by this particular object so having said that enhancement is done it is in a format that is understandable by computers now the next step is to make it human understandable let’s do that and the output has to be saved in a file save it to a file this is the next step we are supposed to do will do that cv2 dot im right image right here u s

always we are supposed to give the path of the file but I want the output file also to be written on to the same directory so I am just giving the desired name, in case you want it in a different path please do specify the complete path I would like to call this as enhance dot png I am ok with the same format in case you want to change the format you can try for changing that too and this image must be an image corresponding to this particular matrix this particular matrix enhanced image the enhanced one from matrix representation which is understandable by computers to representation that is understandable by humans as to be written so we have to pass this as well and this particular file be named as enhanced dot png that is the command we are done with it so once everything is saved to notify us let us print done enhancing I would recommend that please pause the video here take a look at the code I have written with comments please do look at the code understand this once you have understood this completely lets go with running of the code ok now let’s run the code yeah so it is done, done enhancing it shows so let us search for this file enhanced dot png enhanced dot png let us open this ok this is the given file which was not very clear now just observe this is enhanced version of the image the cracks on the wall starting from that every minute detail can be observed it seems some marking is over here even that could be observed alright now we have enhanced this image few more details that are not clearly visible in that original image are now revealed after this enhancement we shall analyse this and this may open up new facts that were earlier un realised thank you for watching this screen cast have a nice day.

You see many a times when we take our own picture we realise we actually appear better then what we are that is because of the inbuilt image processing applications on your cell phone or on your camera so this is a very bid industry as you know look at instagram it takes your picture and shows you ten different ways in which you can sort of enhanced right? So just now we showed you a couple of examples of how you can take an image see it as a matrix and perform operations on it and get a brand new picture out of it right? This was just the beginning it’s a big ocean out there you can actually explore to whatever extent you want.
ANAGRAMS
List slit, lift filt, eat tea, what is common among all these? Let us find out in our forth coming joy named anagrams.
ANAGRAMS 01
Do you know what is Hooke’s law? Well Hooke’s law states that force needed to extend or compresses spring by some distance is proportional to that distance it was discovered by Robert hook. Well in earlier time’s scientist were more concern about protecting their secrets than sharing new knowledge with the world. Robert Hooke first reported Hooke’s law has this which unscrambled to this which means force proportional to stretch, you must be wondering why are we discussing all these, well look at these two words these are called anagrams, anagram is a word or a phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word, let me give you some more examples of anagram. For example listen silent, tar rat, dusty study, inch chin, brag grab, stressed desserts so now let us move towards the programming screen cast of anagrams.
ANAGRAMS 02
Before we move to the programming screen cast of anagrams I like to tell you what are ascii values, ascii is basically A S C I I which stands for American standard code for information interchange, ascii values basically represent character encoding. What do you mean by character encoding here? For example, ASCII value of A is sixty five that means a character represented by some integer value, here integer sixty five represents character A. Similarly we have ascii values for rest of the characters too I will show you, here we have the ASCII table you can see here that the capital A is represented by sixty five, capital B is represented by sixty six, capital c sixty seven, capital d sixty eight which goes till capital z ninety so similarly we have character encoding for this smaller for the lower case letters too for example small a is represented by ninety seven, small b is represented by ninety eight which goes till one twenty two and z is represented by one twenty two similarly for the special symbols also we have the ASCII values for examples exclamation mark is represented by thirty three then hash value is thirty five then dollar sign is represented by thirty six percent sign is represented by thirty seven similarly we have ASCII values for plus minus even round braces so you can see and you can refer this tables for ASCII values and we will be using these ASCII values for the implementation for our program related to anagrams so let us move towards the programming screen cast of anagrams.
ANAGRAMS 03
Welcome to the programming screen cast of anagrams, I hope you know what are ASCII values, I have explained in the previous video if you haven’t watch the previous video please go through the previous video ASCII values basically represent character encoding each character is represented by some integer value ASCII basically stands for American standard code for information interchange this has already been exchanged in the previous video so please go through it now the questions comes how can we find the ascii values in python? How can we find the ASCII values of characters in python? So we have a pre defined function here called ord, ord we have a pre defined function here will be using this to find the ascii value of a particular character so I will just show you for example I need to find the ascii value of capital A so I will just write capital A we have sixty five as I already told you the ascii value of capital a is sixty five of b is sixty six, of c is sixty seven so we will just cross check whether it is giving us the right ascii values so here it is sixty six then capital c we have sixty seven now I will check the value of capital z which is basically ninety, yes it is ninety now we can also check the ascii values of lower case letters so I will just write small a here it is ninety seven that is correct then small b it is ninety eight small c ninety nine and let us also check the ascii value of small z and it is one twenty two yes we have the ascii values here this is how you can find the ascii value of a particular character as I already explained we also have the ascii values for some special symbols like sign of exclamation, @, percent, hash tag so we can also check so let us check for the sign of exclamation it is thirty three you can cross check in the table that we have shown here in the previous video you can cross check with the particular table now we have let us check for @ it is sixty four and for percent sign it is thirty seven for dollar it is thirty six for hash tag it is thirty five so this is how you can find the ascii values of a particular character and some special symbols too so I will advise you to cross check with the table that we have given in the previous video so now let us use this let us use this function to implement anagrams so as you know we have two strings and we need to find whether these two strings are anagram or not? So I will take two strings here I will take str1 and I will input enter the first string I will also take the another string str2 and I will write the input enter the second string second string as you all know by default it takes string as the input we don’t need to type cast is as we do in the case of integer or decimal values whenever you have to take string as an input you don’t need to type cast it you just write the input function input and in the round basis whatever message you want to display so here we are done we have the str1 and str2 we will compare this str1 and compare the str2 and find out whether these two strings are anagrams or not so let us think about it if we have to use the ascii values how can we use it some of the ascii values use of characters present in the anagrams should be same please think about it the some of the ascii values of the characters present in anagrams should be same because both the strings have same set of characters if two strings are anagrams then they should have the same set of characters for example I showed you one example cat and rat both of these strings comprise of three letters three characters R A and T so if we if I sum these values of these both strings the if this if I sum the ascii value of these both strings the answer should be same of the answer is same then these two strings are anagrams otherwise they are not so I will just now I will just write the code to how to sum the ascii values of the characters present in the string so will take
 
count one here I will initialise it to zero I will take the variable I here we will use while loop here I will run my loop till the length of string one since we are trying to sum of ascii values of str1 so I will take this while loop take this length of str1 and what should I write here? I should write here count of one is equal to count of one plus I will use the ord function here str1 of I so we have the count value here now the count one will store the sum of ascii values of the characters present in str1 I should increment the I value here so that it traverses whole of str1 then I will take count two also and this is zero similarly I will apply while loop here too in order to find the sum of ascii values of str2 I will write length of str2 I will write count two is equal to count two plus ord function str2 of I should also increment the I value here so now I think we are done with generating the some of ascii values of both the strings now I will write if count in one is equal to is equal to count two then I have to print these are anagrams anagrams else what do I need to print here I need to print these are not anagrams I will write these are not anagrams so I think we are done with the program what did we do here? We took two strings then we stored the some of the ascii values of the characters present in the both strings in count one and in count two respectively then we compare count one and count two if they are equal then these must be anagrams otherwise these are not anagrams so I will just run this so I will write anagrams dot py I should enter the first string for example I enter listen then I should enter silent as you know listen and silent these both make anagrams but it is saying that these are not anagrams I think we did a mistake here yes we haven’t initialise I again please look at this we haven’t initialise I again we incremented I here so we need to initialise I again because we are using the same variable in both the loops so it was a mistake here so please rectify it we need to initialise I here again so let me run it again I will write silent and listen, let us check whether it put yes these are anagrams these are right so let us let me run it again I will write some example which are not anagrams so I will write for example wet I will write rat these are not anagrams so our programme is giving us the right output so let me also show you what a count one and count two are storing here so you get to know that these are actually the same values count one here and I also print count two here so let us run again so let us take the strings which are anagrams so I will write rat then I will write tar so see these both count one is also three twenty seven count two is also three twenty seven so both are anagrams this should be same and our program is giving us the output these are anagrams since these we already know that these are anagrams so it is giving us the right output so this is how you can code for anagrams I will go through the program again. First of all we should take two strings str1 and str2 and our motive is to figure out whether these two strings are anagrams or not so I will just take one count that is the count one it will store the ascii values, sum of the ascii values of the characters present in the str1 I initialise the I is equal to zero then I had then I will have the while loop which will run till length of str1 and then we are storing the sum in count one and we are using the ord function to find the ascii values it will store the sum of the ascii values of the characters present in the str1 and then we are incrementing I here and I am printing the some of the ascii values here of str1 then we are initialising another variable that is count two which will store the sum of ascii values of the characters of str2 and then we also have I is equal to zero why do we need to do this because we have already incremented in the previous loop and we are using the same and we are using the same variable here so we need to initialise it again so I initialise it again so I wrote I is equal to zero then I again had a while loop which will count

the number the sum of ascii values present in str2 and then I printed these count two value and then I checked if count one is equal to is equal to count two if these both are equal then these are anagrams otherwise these are not anagrams so I hope you understood the logic behind it, what is the logic behind it? If two strings are anagrams then the sum of the ascii values of the characters present in the both the strings should be same this is self evident as I showed you we have different examples here silent listen tar rat and in silent and listen the set of characters present in the str1 and str2 they are same the ascii values should also be same so that’s why we took the sum of all these ascii values and checked whether these two are equal if these are equal then the strings are anagrams otherwise they are not anagrams well there are many other ways in which with which you can find out whether two strings are anagrams or not! We like you to discuss on discussion form the other ways of how to find, how to figure out whether two strings are anagrams or not in the fourth coming screen cast I will be telling you one more way through which you can figure out whether two strings are anagrams are not. Thank you.
ANAGRAMS 04
Welcome again to the programming screen cast of anagrams in this particular programming screen cast I will be discussing another way to figure out whether two strings are anagrams or not. In the previous programming screen cast we have already discussed a way to figure out whether two strings are anagrams or not, in this particular programming screen cast I will be discussing another way this particular method requires the use of sorted function. So what is sorted function? Sorted basically sorts any sequence list for example list and returns the sorted list so I will show you how can you use the sorted function for example I have a list here named x of integer values and the values present in this is not sorted for example they are four three one two now if I write print sorted of x see it printed the sorted value and it printed the sorted values in ascending order so sorted function basically returns the sorted values in ascending order I repeat sorted function by default sorts the value present in the list in ascending order so id I want to sort the list in descending order what should I do? Well we have a way here, how can you do that? For example we have sorted x and this will pass another parameter named reverse and in this I will write true so let us check whether it works or not yes it works, so if I write reverse is equal to true then it will sort the values in ascending order so I repeat sorted functions sorts the value in ascending order and if I write reverse is equals to true it will sort the values in descending order this is how you can use the sorted function, you can also use the sorted function on different data types for example we can use the sorted function on character values too for example I have ‘x’ as the list of characters as q for example w e r t and y now if I write print sorted of ‘x’ press enter so as you see it has sorted the values in alphabetical order so first of all we have e then q r t w and y so if we have list of characters then sort it functions sorts the character in alphabetical order and you can also use the string in this sorted function let us find out how can you use that for example x is a string here and we have python x is a string which has the value python here if I write again print sorted of x and what should it print, yes it has sorted the characters of python in alphabetical order first of all h then n then n o p t and y so now you see you can use a integer list you can use a character list and you can also use the string and use it in sorted function to sort the values present in the particular list or string and I hope that you are already aware of dictionaries we can also use sorted to sort the dictionary so how can you do that, I will take the dictionary here I will again name it as ‘x’ so I will write for example q, q is the key here and one is the value then I will take w, w is the key here and two is the value and then I have e here for example and its value is three and let’s take one more value I will just write four here and then I will take t here its value is zero so we have a invalid syntax here let us find out where is the problem, so the problem is we didn’t use the curly braces yes in dictionary we should use the curly braces and in list we use the square the rectangle braces so we should use the curly braces here and then if I write print sorted or ‘x’ see it is sorted the values in alphabetical order again first of all we have e then q then t and w so it is sorting the dictionary values on the basis of keys yes it is sorting the dictionary values on the basis of keys please note this fact now I have another example here for example I have a list of strings example I have ccccc bb then a then ddd and I want to sort this list on the basic of the length of this particular string yes I want to sort this list on the basis of length of particular list so the output should be first of all since a is the list since a is the string in the smallest length so first
 
of all a should be printed then bb should be printed then ddd then ccccc should be printed so how can you do that? This is fairly easy, you just need to write print sorted capital l and the key should be length just write length here and I press enter here I have the desired output I sorted this list of string on the basis of length of the particular string so first of all I have a here then bb then ddd then ccccc so this is how you can sort this on the basis of length of the particular string so I hope now sorted function is clear to you guys now I will use the sorted function in our program in our program to figure out whether two strings are anagrams or not so first of all we should take two strings I will take them str1 and str2 I will just write input enter the first string then I should write str2 is equal to input enter the second string now you can figure out what purpose would sorted function would serve what purpose would sorted function serve here so we can sort this to list str1 and str2 and if the sorted version of these two list is same if the sorted version of these two list is same then you can say that str1 and str2 are anagrams otherwise they are not what should I write here? If sorted of str1 is equal to is equal to sorted of str2 then I should print these are anagrams else I should print these are not anagrams so let us run this program I just save it as anagrams two dot py enter the first string I will enter listen, enter the second string I will enter silent these are anagrams so our output is correct if I run it again enter the first string hello enter the second string thyui any random string these are not anagrams so our output is correct so I will also show you whether the sorted version of these two list are same so I will just print sorted str1 and then print sorted str2 so now let us try to run this again so I will take another anagram example I will take tar and I will take rat sorry I typed it as r a y so these are not anagrams but you see the sorted version are not even same first of all they are a r t then it is a r y now let us check on the list that our anagrams so I will write rat I will write tar so as you can see the sorted version of these two lists are same so first of all let us a r t for rat and for tar it is a r t so for sorted version so these two list is same that’s why these are anagram and we can also take the example of two lists of not anagrams so I will just write another list for example how and wow how and wow these are not anagrams since the sorted version of these two list is not same so you can now figure out how you can now figure out how to check whether two strings are anagrams are not and I will just go through the program again first of all you need to input two strings that is fairly simple and then you need to check whether the sorted version of these two list are same, if they are same they are anagrams if they are not same these are not anagrams so this program of anagrams was fairly easy you just need to apply a function and there you are you get the answer so we have discussed two ways whether two strings are anagrams or not there are I think many other ways through which you can figure out I like you to discuss on discussion form and bring out some most nice ideas to check whether two strings are anagrams or not. I hope this programming screen cast was useful to you guys if you have any problem any doubt please refer the discussion form we are there to help. Thank you.
FACEBOOK SENTIMENT ANALYSIS 02
You saw what happened? People tend to be putting a whole lot of their life status on facebook in fact someone who is very active on facebook can actually we revealing more than what he suppose to reveal, in fact just by looking at his status updates you can see when he is on a high when he is on a general low in mood. Facebook is such a happening place but sometimes I suspect are people active in their real life as they are on facebook? What comes to your mind when I say analyse a given data? What is data to begin with? So how many times do I smile in a day? How many straights of walk do I take every day? What is my salt intake on an average per day? Sugar intake, how much junk though I eat, how many hours do I sleep? Don’t you think if I get this data for one full year and then analyse it, put exactly can one infer, we probably can infer how healthy a life style we are living right? This is what you mean by data analytics, analysing the given data. If something as simple and straight forward as number of walking straights you take per day, say something about your fitness level. What about the data you update on facebook? Your overall activity on facebook, do you think we can infer something from an active facebook user, the fact is it’s not something we can infer a whole lot of things. Assume I take all the data that you have shared on facebook from the past one month, status one, status two, status three, status four up to let’s say some hundred status messages that you have shared from the past one month by observing this what can I infer? For example if my status was something like life isn’t fair as I expected it to be, don’t you think I am sounding slightly negative? Right, second example assume my status were to be something like this, I am proud of my country, I made it sound positive but irrespective of the tone in which one might talk the very sentence I am proud of my country gives a positive connotation right? Now let us look at the third example, et your goals right! so its a very suggestive one liner neither positive nor negative its neutral correct? Do you see the sentiment of the first sentence being negative, second being positive the third being neutral as and always what are we doing? Programming of course. I told you three sentences and even told you and you realised that it was positive, negative and neutral. Is there any way we can write a piece of code which does the same without any human intervention what if we can use computer programs to predict what is the sentiment of a given sentence? Of what use will that be? U know where I am getting that I told you I take one month’s data of a person which comprises of hundred status message, yeah he has updated hundred status messages I take all of them s one s two s three up to s hundred and then I look at the sentiment of these sentences assume eighty on hundred where negative which means this person is undergoing some trauma in his life or isn’t in general happy person on the contrary what if ninety messages out of hundred where full of joy it means this person if too look out for a spouse you should marry this person right? a very happy partner will spread sort of happiness and happiness as you know is contagious right, what amount of this hundred status messages are positive how many of them are negative? And how many of them are neutral? Don’t you think if we ask and answer this question we can say something about this person himself, I am interested in doing the following exercises, I want to take all the status messages I have ever updated on face book ever since I was part of the facebook, let’s say from two thousand eight I think I am there on facebook, it’s been more than ten years. So what I would like to d o is download all my status updates and try to analyse all of them by looking at the
 
sentiments of individual status updates and see which are the months I was more happy then unhappy and months where I was unhappier than happier, times when I was neutral and so on, you see you can ask a lot of questions but hurdle here is how do I download my data which is ten years old, once downloaded how do I measure the sentiments of my status updates, this in fact is very easy to do today, in fact you can do it for your won facebook data as well and we are going to illustrate it for you. Point number one, we will tell you how to download your facebook data, point number two python to our rescue we will tell you how to use the exact python api to analyse your face book data
FACEBOOK SENTIMENT ANALYSIS 03
Welcome all to the programming screen cast of facebook sentiment analysis, I will be going step by step and explain you how to do facebook sentiment analysis, we will be giving you background of sentiment analysis and others things too. So let us start with the programming screen cast. So first of all what do you have to do in here is first of all you have to download the facebook data and store it in excel file I will show you how can you download the facebook data, for that you must login to your facebook account, so here is my facebook account I have already logged in here first of all you need to download your facebook data, how can you do that? For that you must go to the settings in your profile as you are saying I will go to the settings here I have your facebook information and as you can see I have a tab on the left pane your facebook information so clink on that here is my facebook information here I have download your information, you can download your copy of your information to keep or to transfer to another service so click on that view as you all can see I have my facebook account information here I have the information In the form of posts, photos and videos, comments, likes and reactions, friends etc etc so first of all you need to create a file here you can see this button create file click on this, as you can see here it is written your file is being processed we let you know when its complete so it will take some time to create the file and then you can download your file yes so I have already downloaded my facebook information, I will I will show you here I have my facebook and my user name and you can see I have all the information in here, I have about you, I have friends, my followers, messages, pages, payment history everything is stored here so when you will create file here and download your file you will be your information will be downloaded in the formation of these folders yes, you will be given one zip folder and in that folder you will be given this information, you will be given the information about your friends about your groups, likes, reactions, messages everything will be there so here is our information, what you need to do next is, you need to store this information in an excel file yes so I will just show you for example I have folder here name post so I will just click here, here I have my post other people post to my timeline and my own post too so I have open this page so here is my post it is basically your post that means only my posts are shown here these are all the posts that I have posted on my timeline, so what you need to do here is, you need to store this post in an excel file for that I have created an excel file for example here all the post I have stored in an excel file so you need to do the same thing you need to just copy your post from this html file and you need to paste this these post in an excel file ok I repeat how can you download your facebook data, first of all you need to go to the settings in your facebook profile in settings you will be given facebook information you need to click on the facebook information tab on the left pane after going there you will be asked to download your information here first of all you need to create file, the file on the folder will be created and you will be given a folder like this, you will be given a folder like this here you will be having each and every
 
information related to your facebook profile, information regarding your friends, your post network information so this is how you can download your facebook data for our programme you need to save this information in an excel file so you pick and y folder for example I picked post and then I open your post dot html which came like this and I stored these post in an excel file, I just copied these posts and stored it in it in an excel file as you can see these are all the posts that I have stored here ok so you just save these post in an excel file and save this file you will be using this file for our programme, this is how you download your facebook information and store it in facebook, store it in excel file so first and the foremost step is you need to download your facebook data and store it in an excel file, then what you need to do is you need to import the pandas library, it what purpose does it serve, it provides easy to use data structure for data analysis, you will get to know how what are this data structures eventually in our programming screen cast? Then you need to import the nltk library it is a library which is used to process human language, yes it is a library which is used to process human language what does nltk do here? It provides sentiment analysis of human data, so what is sentiment analysis? Sentiment analysis involves working out whether a piece of text is positive, negative or neutral, for example if I ask you how are you? This is a neutral sentence and if I say I am very very very happy today this Is a positive sentence and if I say I don’t know where my life is going and I am very sad so this is a negative sentence so sentiment analysis involves working out a piece of text and figuring out what whether it is positive negative or neutral so this is sentiment analysis so what will be you doing here is the file that you have stored, the post that you have stored in an excel file will be analysing them will be analysing them on the basis of sentiment analysis will be analysing your post whether your post are negative, positive or neutral so this is facebook sentiment analysis. Then we will use Vader, what is Vader? Vader is valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoned, yes Vader, it is used for sentiment analysis but it not only tells you whether a piece of text is positive negative or neutral it also takes into account the intensity of the sentiment yes it also takes into the account the intensity of the sentiment what do I mean by that? For example I said I am very very happy today, that it will also tell me that this sentence is eighty percent positive or seventy percent positive it will also tell me this the intensity of my sentiment ok so will be using vader here, vader stands for valence aware dictionary and sentiment reasoned it takes into account the intensity of the sentiment too you need to download the vader lexicon, what is the lexicon? Lexicon acts as a dictionary here, lexicon acts as a dictionary here and then you need to convert your excel sheet that you have created to data frame with the help of pandas, what is a data frame? A data frame is a two dimensional structure in the form of a table so pandas provides you with the data frame facility as I said pandas provides you easy to use data structure and data frame is one of them, will be using them in one of our program. So this is the step by step guide to our program. How can we do facebook sentiment analysis? I know some of the things are not clear here when we will do programming screen cast everything thing will become clear here so I just revise what we have done till now, first of all we need to download your facebook data, you need to login to your facebook account and then you need to go to

settings and download your facebook information there we need to store your information In an excel file that I have already explained then you need to import the pandas library it basically provide you easy to use data structure for data analysis then you need to import nltk library nltk library will help you to process the human language it will basically help you to analyse the human data it will help you in sentimental analysis of human data, sentiment analysis involves working out whether a piece of text is a positive negative or neutral I have already given you a example of a positive neutral and negative sentences then you will not be using only nltk will be using vader too vader also takes into account the intensity of the sentiment, yes then you need to download the vader lexicon, lexicon acts as a dictionary here, you also need to convert your excel sheet that you have created to a data frame, what is a data frame? Data frame is basically two dimensional structures in the form of table which is provided by panda’s library so this is it now will be proceeding to the programming screen cast in the next video. Thank you.
FACEBOOK SENTIMENT ANALYSIS 04
So now let us start with the programming screen cast of facebook sentiment analysis I hope you have watched the previous videos, if you haven’t I suggest you to watch the previous videos and start with the program of facebook sentiment analysis and I think you all know what is sentiment analysis now so what is basically sentiment analysis? Sentiment analysis helps you to figure out whether the piece of text is positive negative or neutral yes facebook sentiment analysis will help you realise the sentiment analysis of your facebook data so first of all you need to download your facebook data this tips have already been explained in the previous video so you first download your facebook data store it in a excel file, you download your facebook data and store it in a excel file will be using this excel file in this program so as I already explained you first need to import the pandas library so I will just write import pandas as pd then you also need to import the nltk library which will help you in sentiment analysis, I will write import nltk after that you need to import the vader library so what do you need to do here is, you write from nltk dot sentiment dot vader import sentiment intensity analyser so you need to import these three libraries pandas, nltk and from vader you need to import sentiment intensity analyser then I asked you to download the vader lexicon you can download directly from here I will just write the command please pay attention I will write nltk dot downloader dot download and in bracket you need to write vader underscore lexicon, lexicon basically acts as a dictionary here so you need to also download that for downloading will lexicon you have a command nltk dot downloader dot download and in package you need to download, you need to write vader underscore lexicon hen I will load my file here what my file name is data underscore file dot excel sx this is my file name in the previous videos like in speech recognition you had a doubt that where do we need to store the file which we are going to use in the program for example in speech recognition we used audio file all of you had a doubt that where do we need to store that file, actually you can store that file anywhere in your system bottom line is you need to provide proper path to your file yes, you need to provide proper path to your file for example here my data underscore file is in download so I will give a proper path here the path here is basically users simran setia that is my user name then in that I have the download folder and in that I have my data file ok so I hope that is clear to all of you, you need to provide a proper path ok you can store your file any where nut you need to provide proper path in your program so I have loaded my file that is done it is basically xlsx so I have imported the library I have also downloaded the vader underscore lexicon and then I have also loaded my data file here and next what you need to do is, you need to read from the excel file so I just write excel is equal to pd I will use pandas library to read my excel file I will write excel file and in bracket where is y excel file it has been loaded in the variable file so what this is doing? This is reading from the read from excel I repeat pandas library will help you to it is basically pd dot pandas library will help you to read from the excel file so will write pd because u have imported pandas as pd I will write pd dot excel fie and in bracket I write my file variable name that is file here ok so I have read my excel file with the help of pandas library as I already said pandas provide you easy to use data structure so will be passing this excel file converting this excel file to data frame, what is a data frame? As explained, data frame is a two dimensional structure in a form of a table so data frame will help you to analyse your data easily, as you know pandas
 
library provide you with the facility you can convert your excel file to some other data structure which are easy to analyse yes so will be converting our excel file to data frames so I just write dfs is equal to xl dot parse and I will write xl dot sheet underscore names zero here we are storing our information in the first column so I will write zero here I will just show you for example in the first column only I have stored all my post information you can see here, I have stored all the information in the first column so I will write zero here so I will write hash what is this statement doing? Parsing the excel sheet to data frame, parsing the excel sheet to data frame next what do you have to do here is you need to update your data frames as per your requirement for example here I have some blank rows here as you can see I have some blank rows here I need to delete this blank rows from my data frames so I will just write dfs is equal to list dfs and in square bracket I will write timeline because that is the name of my column ok and then I also print the all dfs so what it is basically doing here is it is removing the row from the data frame I will write it removes the blank rows from the data frame. So we will just run our program here and see how data frames are coming so I will just run so I first need to store my file I will store facebook dot py so as you can see I have my data in the form of data frames whatever has been written in the excel file is here because I have converted that excel file to data frames so we have the data frames here now we have the data frames next step would be analysing them so we will do sentiment analysis on this data frames so what will I write here, first of all I initialise my sentiment intensity analyser I will write sid is equal to sentiment intensity analyzer then as you can see in my excel file I have this information too that when my post was posted for example the particular time and date is already been is also been return so I need not analyse this information the particular time information so what will I do here is whenever my whenever this sentiment analyser would encounter this the timeline information the time information it won’t analyse it, it will only analyse my post ok I repeat here for example I have here Monday march twenty seven twenty seventeen so this has nothing to do with sentiment analysis so I will just remove this I will not remove here from the excel file I will just hardcoded in my program so that whenever my program encounters this particular statement this time information it skips that information and it doesn’t do sentiment analysis on that information so I will just write here I will store it in str1 so what is the information it is basically utc plus zero five thirty so it may be different for your for excel file so you need to check in your excel file if there is such kind of information you can skip that information because this has nothing to do with the sentiment analysis so now I will write for data in dfs a is equal to data dot find str1 this particular command will str1 in my excel file in my data frames and if it, it will basically return a Boolean value here for example if it returns minus one here that means it hasn’t found that str1 in that particular a for example here I have the data here I have the data and if it encounter this particular line Monday march twenty seven twenty seventeen and it has encounter this str1 also here so it won’t return minus one here because it has found that utc plus five thirty here but it hasn’t found that utc plus five thirty here that means it is an information that needs to be analysed that we need to analyse the that we need to analyse this particular information we need to perform sentiment analysis on this particular information so if it is hasn’t found this str1 that means we need to analyse that particular statement so I will just write ss is equal to sid dot polarity underscore scores data whatever data it has encounter now, now it need to be analyse we needs to perform sentiment analysis on it so it will print

the data here also print the data and then for k in ss write print k and then ss of k it will basically print whether the basic information is positive negative or neutral and it will also print the intensity of the sentiment too I will just run this file then you will get to know what I am trying to say here so I will just run it let us just run it let us just run this so super we have all the information here we have all the timeline information here so for example my first post was this row rohith Sharma wants to read the murder of roger whatever it is and then it has given the polarity also that it is point two five one negative it is point seven four nine neutral and it is zero positive and the it is also given some compound information compound information is aggregate of all the sentiment for example it is negative also neutral also but the compound information says that it is point minus point six nine that means it is negative similarly in the fourth coming post too it has return that is zero negative it is point seven two one neutral and it is point two seven nine positive and it is also given the compound information since the negative value here is zero and here is positive so the compound information the compound sentiment is also positive here so it is analyse each and every information given in the excel file and it is return that whether it is negative neutral positive and also the compound sentiment that we can figure out from the from this information so I think now everything is clear to you guys now I will revise the each step here also so first of all what do you need to do here is you need to import the libraries basically you need to import three libraries here you need to import pandas you need to import nltk and you also need to import vader here so I have imported these three libraries then I have downloaded the vader underscore lexicon you also need to download that and then I need to load the file here since I have already explained you need to provide proper path to your file you can store your file anywhere in your system then I read from the excel file after reading from the excel file I will pass the excel file to data frames yes data frames is the facility that has been provided to us by the pandas library, data frames are basically two dimensional structure in that form of a table it makes the analysis easy and then I have removed the blank rows that at present in my excel file so this is how you do it after that I have print I have printed my data frames that each and every data frame is printed here after that I have initialised my sentiment intensity analyzer and then I have explained you guys that I have in my excel file I have also the time information the time at which my post was posted on my timeline so I need not analyze this information this has no relevance so whenever my program encounters this particular str that is the time information and then it skips that particular statement and goes to the next statement so for that I have taken a variable a here whenever in my data str1 is found and if str1 is found it needs to skip that for example that means if its values is minus one it hasn’t found that str1 yes I repeat if its value is minus one it hasn’t found that str one so now I need to analyze that particular statement if A value is minus one that means it hasn’t found that particular statement that particular time information so I will just analyze that statement for that I need to write sid dot polarity underscore scores and in bracket you need to supply data then I have printed that data and then for ‘k’ and ss I have printed the particular ‘k’, ‘k’ will denote here whether it is negative neutral or positive and ss k will tell you the intensity of the particular sentiments ‘k’ here is the sentiment ss of ‘k’ here is the intensity of the sentiment I hope that this programming screen cast was useful to you guys and you have understood it well and if you have any doubts please post on the discussion form we are there to help you. Thank you, thank you so much.
