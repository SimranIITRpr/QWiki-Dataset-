i am getting TypeError: '<=' not supported between instances of 'int' and 'tuple'


for i in range(img.size[0]):

   for j in range(img.size[1]):
       if(pixelMap[i,j]>=0 and pixelMap[i,j]<=31) :
           pixelNew[i,j] = 0
       
       elif(pixelMap[i,j]>=32 and pixelMap[i,j]<=63) :
           pixelNew[i,j] = 1
how to remove this type error

When i printed pixelMap[i,j] it printed a tuple. so i have worked on the code below. kindly go through it.

comment the if loops try printing pixelMap[i,j] and see what it returns.

harsha, run the following code with comp = 2,4,8,16,32 and see how the pictures look like. pixelmap and pixel new are tuples. i dont know how their code worked. run the following code with any picture. I dowloaded a colour india map and saw what is the difference.



import numpy


from PIL import Image


im=Image.open("india_map.jpg")


comp=32


pixelmap=im.load()


m=numpy.asanyarray(Image.open('india_map.jpg'))


print(m) # orignial matirx


img=Image.new(im.mode,im.size)


pixelnew=img.load()

for i in range(img.size[0]):



   for j in range(img.size[1]):


       temp=[1,2,3]


       for k in range(3):


         temp[k]=int(pixelmap[i,j][k]/comp)


       pixelnew[i,j]=tuple(temp)


       #print(pixelnew[i,j])
       
       
img.save('india_map1.jpg')


j=numpy.asanyarray(Image.open('india_map1.jpg')) #reduced matrix

I posted the code in the Super user notes. instead of writing so many if statements i just divided the pixelmap by the number and took the integer portion of it, which made to play with the code so that i can see what happens when i change the values of compression

All Assignments answers week 10. Friends share you programs too please.

Forgive me for being busy. This week's Assignment was fun (I mean looking at answers and comparing with my solutions). I understood in a different way and still was able to finish Assignments 2: Jump. Please go through my code and you are welcome to laugh. :D

A1-Special Character - code:
I experimented with this assignment. I wanted to see if we can do it all in a single "print", and I did. :) List comprehension is such a beautiful part in Python. I am Loving it.


-----------
# METHOD :1
-----------
print(*['NO' if ''.join(input().split()).isalnum() else "YES"],sep="",end="")

-----------
# METHOD :2
-----------
S = input()
def anythingspecial(a):
    a=''.join(a.split())
    if a.isalnum():
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

print(anythingspecial(S), end="")

-----------
# METHOD :2.1
-----------
S = input()
def anythingspecial(a):
    if ''.join(a.split()).isalnum():
        return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

print(anythingspecial(S), end="")

A2-Jumps - code:
This is the assignment I was talking about. Still it works... because of the if condition. This could be wrong too. I admit that the question is still confusing for me.

A = int(input())

def possible(a):
  if a == 0 or a%3 == 0:
    return "YES"
  else:
    return "NO"

print(possible(A), end="")

A3-Calculate - code:
import math
D = list(map(int,input().split(',')))
C = 50; H = 30;
Q = [round(math.sqrt((2*C*d)/H)) for d in D]
print(*Q,sep=",", end="")

For those who didn't understand the Q "comprehension" part

#Comprehension Part.
for d in D:
    Q.append(round(math.sqrt((2*C*d)/H)))

NOTE: Please also check Sample solutions, Provided by instructor they are interestingly different approach/methods.

Jumps is a puzzle . Here is my code which is almost similar to provided by TAs


n=int(input())
m=n%6
l=[0,1,3]
if m in l:
  print("YES",end="")
else:
  print("NO",end="")

For Next Semester if possible consider giving different assignments for different people ie four or five assignments under programming assignment 1 and so on.. So that they will not copy. Because some one is posting the assignment solutions in youtube, excpet for few students who are trying their best, for the rest the course has become just copy and paste. Any how since they have not gone through the material thoroughly they will have issues in scoring in the final exam.

Assignment 9:question 5
One comment • 5 months ago
AI (talkcontribs)
How can quantitative be correct. We cannot analyze the whole body of work done by any author and if we are doing a quantitative study the purpose of analysis is defeated. I think we are doing a qualitative analysis as we are studying the author's style of writing, words commonly used by the author and so on. This cannot be called quantitative study. Else I request you to elaborate the difference between the two as interpreted in this answer. Thank You.

The given steps are one step, two steps and three steps. ie after one step again you cannot take only one step. you have to take two steps only and after two steps you have to take three steps not one step or two steps. No matter what the final destination is you will be either on the spot, or one step away from it or One+two= three steps or one+two+three=six steps away from the destination Since it is always in one+two+three=six. So you can group them in steps of six and see how many steps are remaining either one step or three steps or have you already reached the destination(Six steps=zero steps)

Suppose 57. So 57=6*9+3 so 3 means i can achieve it because 1+2=3



1000=6*166+4. So 4 cannot be achieved because only possibilities are 0,1,3, as 6 is nothing but zero.

dest = int(input())

while True:

 if dest == x:
   f = 1
   break
 elif dest < x:
   f = 0
   break
 else:
   x = x + l[i]
   i = (i + 1) % 3
   
if f == 1:

 print('YES')

 print('NO')

but this is not working for hidden test cases

I tested your code for variable dest with values from 7 to 18. it is working fine. They have already mentioned your program needs to be efficient. This is exactly what they said you should not do. I have given dest = 10**18. in spyder looks like it is going to take good amount of time .

As i said in hints earlier only the last steps are important. why are doing calculations from the beginning till the end.

1+2+3=6 after 6 say 7,8,9,10,11,12 I am least bother about the first 6 steps. I will calculate (7-6),(8-6),(9-6),(10-6),(11-6),(12-6). What ever value i get i will check if they can be achieved.


case 1: So going forward in this manner suppose if dest =53 I am least bothered about the first 48 steps. i will check is 53-48 = 5 will check weather 5 can be achieved with the given steps pattern


case 2: suppose dest=1000 I am least bothered about the first 996 steps(6*166) and i will focus on only 1000-996=4 and will check weather the 4 can be achieved with the given pattern


case 3 Suppose dest=15769 ( a Random number) and the number closet to it is 15768(2628*6) and the difference i will be focused is 15769-15768=1 and will check if 1 can be achieved or not..

.
in case 1, if i know 5, in case 2 if i know 4 and in case 3 if i know 1, ie sufficent for me. so how are these numbers achieved they are nothing but remainders when divided by 6.


After this the decide the possible remainders you can have

they are 1, 1+2=3,1+2+3=6 6 is nothing but zero. so the remainders you can have are 0,1,3. Hence in short get the remainder and see if it equal to 0,1,3 you can achieve it else you can drop.

Others may comment on how they have achieved.


For the last 10 minutes when i gave dest=10*18, your code is still running. I dont know wheather browser will wait that much time to get the response.

simple words take the number divide it by 6 and get the remainder. check if the remainder is 0,1 or 3. if is 0,1,or 3 print yes other wise no. I was just trying to explain whats happening here with out using the word remainder

Reply 5 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
My observation with python is if it says an error in a particular line and if you dont find an error in that particular line, the error will be definitely in the previous line. if i understand your code properly the 8th line is f.append. there is no error in this line. in the previous line if you see you have opened 3 brackets and closed only two brackets. may this could be an error. kindly check

If some line is giving error and if i am not able to understand it, i generally remove that line from the code and see what happens. then the error is either shifted to next line or the error is removed.if the error is shifted to next line, you can repeat the process or removing next line. if the error is eliminated that means that line has some error. if the error is shifted to next line may be the previous line also may have the error.

Stylometry is the quantitative study of literary style through computational distant reading methods.

in assignment evaluation its taken as qualitative study of literary. Please cross check sir.

AI (talkcontribs)
I think the correct answer should be qualitative as the style of writing is checked and not quantitative as the entire quantity of an author's work is not checked. I feel it has been evaluated correctly. But then the video transcripts say differently. This needs a clarification. Thanks

Answer should be tuple of nodes because in console we can see after writing G.nodes() we get output Out[4]: NodeView((1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9)) which is a tuple. Documentation also says it returns tuple. When we use print(G.nodes()) then it returns list. So, according to question answer must be tuple.

Please elaborate tokenization. How Tokenisation involves splitting sentences from the text. As I understood, it only involves splitting of the words from the text.

It depends on the delimiter being used. If you use ., then it will split the text after every .

scipy.misc.read(), infact, gives error. This is also evident in the programming screen cast. Hence the question itself is wrong as error or none of the above are not given in the answers. Instead of scipy.misc.read() , scipy.misc.imread() gives the result. Please check the programming screen cast. Please re-evaluate this question.

what is your approach. i have given i=10**!8 print(i) print(type(i)) it is properly printing the i value and type as integer. The reason you are getting zeros could be the reason they have mentioned in the description. your program should be efficient other wise it will give run time error. I am not sure how runtime error will result in. If you could give your approach we could discuss further. I have discussed the way i have approached this in comment to other users question. kindly go through it.

Do a dry run on your copy. Write all jump places upto a point and try to find a pattern. Then you'll see you don't have to worry about large numbers. Hint:- It has something to do with no. 3
