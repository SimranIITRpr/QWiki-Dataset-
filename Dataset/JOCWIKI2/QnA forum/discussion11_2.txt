Note: Hello friends please share your programs too, if you have a better code or different approach than these programs. Everyone, who struggled to finish assignments, please ask you questions here. So that we all can learn and help each-other.

A1-Marks Distribution - CODE:
I didnt had time to solve this so I used @Kamalakar's logic. It Works too. It is simple and fast. Similar to instructor's solution.

-----------
# METHOD :1
-----------
n,s=map(int,input().split())
A=sorted(list(map(int,input().split())))
M=[(max(A[i:i+s]))-(min(A[i:i+s])) for i in range(len(A)-(s-1))]
print(min(M), end="")

For those who didn't understand the M "comprehension" part

#Comprehension Part.
M=[]
for i in range(len(A)-(s-1)):
    t=A[i:i+s]
    M.append((max(t))-(min(t)))

-----------
# METHOD :2
-----------
n,s=map(int,input().split())
A=sorted(list(map(int,input().split())))
M=0
if ((s or n)!=0 and s<n):
    for i in range(len(A)-(s-1)):
        t = A[i:i+s]
        if (max(t))-(min(t)) < M:
            M=(max(t))-(min(t))

print(M, end="")

A2-String Sort - CODE:
-----------
# METHOD :1.0
-----------
print(*sorted(list(input().split(","))), sep=",", end="")

-----------
# METHOD :1.1
-----------
string_w=list(input().split(","))
string_w.sort()
print(*string_w, sep=",", end="")

A3-Push The Zero - CODE:
a=list(map(int,input().split()))
c=a.count(0)
while 0 in a:
  a.remove(0)
for z in range(c):
  a.append(0)
print(*a, sep=" ", end="")

NOTE: Please also check Sample solutions, Provided by instructor they are interestingly different approach/methods.

Code for Marks distribution
One comment • 5 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
My solution for the code


a,b=input().split()
a=int(a)
b=int(b)
m=input().split()
n=list(map(int,m))
n.sort()
p=[]
for i in range(0,len(m)-b):
  s=n[i+b-1]-n[i]
  p.append(s)
print(min(p),end="")



after reviewing TAs assignment solution I would have not have passed the solutions if they had given n=m=0 and n<m cases. Thank god for not giving such cases.

TAs should also have mentioned about the abnormal number of cases in test cases like in jumps case in previous week assignment, Friends kindly post your solution

As u didn't mentioned about singapore in the question then how option a will be the answer.we have many countries other than singapore. As u asked only the syntax to change timezone then option should be t=pytz.timezone(input()) but there is no option like this.we have confused with the question.as u didn't mentioned singapore in question we have gone with option d sir.Please check once sir.

Week 11 Assignment

Shwethaa (talkcontribs)
Hi All, I executed this program for the marks distribution assignment.It executes perfectly for all the public cases but doesn't pass even 1 private case.Can someone help me out here?

import itertools n,m=num=list(map(int, input().split())) num=list(map(int, input().split())) diff=[max(x)-min(x) for x in itertools.permutations(num,m)] print(min(diff),end=)

For reference,permutations returns all possible permutations of elements of num(iterable data structure) taken m at a time.

Reply 5 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
kindly give this line as input num=[x for x in range(300)] instead of input.split line for num. and compile your program you will see all your test cases failed with a message saying "time limit exceeded" when you compile and run your program we dont know how many values are given in private case.

Reply 5 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
You have built a good logic here. I think possibly it is taking more time to go through all permutations, and the automation is stopping it in the middle. OR

...on the second thought, It is observed that trickiest test cases are mostly kept hidden. So, we should think in other possible ways like removing duplicates in the generated list (comprehension part in your program) etc... or wait till answers are revealed.

Sorry, I haven't solved this Assignment yet. So, I cant say the possible solution.

Reply Edited 5 months ago
Shwethaa (talkcontribs)
Do you think maybe I should try itertools.combinations instead of permutations? Do let me know when you try it out if you are able to pass all test cases.

Reply 5 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
Sorry, i am busy these days and didn't solve this yet. itertools.combinations Will remove duplicates in marks distribution. But i believe there is something missing in the program. Is your program handling negative marks/numbers too? this is the only thing i can think of for now. I am really sorry.

@Shwethaa, @Kamalakar, It is weird! or They should have mentioned in the question that, "we should assign marks (from a sorted list) in incrementing order, without jumping any numbers". That is what I understood! Based on the logic explaination by @Kamalakar in the above link. It works friend @Kamalakar, and yes it passes all Hidden test cases. But still...

I think, @Shwethaa's logic is correct too. As it checks every combination and accurately points to the shortest difference between min and max marks allotted to students (if all marks are only positive). Still I can't be sure... till I see all Hidden test cases.

Reply Edited 5 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
it is upto you how you write the code. as per me this is the simplest logic i could have arrived at solving the problem.

In the jumps problem they mentioned the program should be efficient. i have seen some of programs though correct when run on spyder failed in the browser. i attributed it to the efficiency of the program.

So i thought this could be the issue.

When i searched the page code it is showing 20 seconds as timeout for the page.

Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
Friend @Kamalakar, I am not saying that you are wrong or she is. I am just puzzled, why going through all combinations is not passing Hidden test cases. This is a interesting assignment after a few weeks (Even Week 12 is having some interesting Assignments). I am waiting for professor's Solution for week 11.

I understood that we can get away by solving, roughly, 1/4th of these sort of problems. Because of combinations, we get repeated numbers anyway.

Reply Edited 5 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
the first thing that came into my mind is that i need to sort the numbers first. this is becuase the difference between any two numbers is minimum when they are close to each other. when i have to pick three or four numbers and then i have to find the numbers , i think this would be the much better than selecting the values randomly sorting and taking the numbers in order will involve less number of calculations than randomly picking any two numbers and finding the min.

I checked the week3 assignment. it was the same there also. so the guy who has programmed the webpages might have set it to 20 seconds.

Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
@Shwethaa, This is what I thought your program was overlooking. But still... it failed all Hidden test cases. Lets wait and see why it is failing Hidden test cases. Try @Kamalakar's logic for now. It worked!

import itertools
n,s=map(int,input().split())
A=list(map(int,input().split()))
#n,s=7, 0
#A=[7, 3, 2, 4, 8, 12, 56]
M=set()
for d in itertools.combinations(A,s):
    
    if len(d) != (0 or 1):
        if (min(d) and max(d)) >= 0:
            m=max(d)-min(d)
        elif min(d) < 0 <= max(d):
            m=min(d)+max(d)
        else:
            m=(max(d))-(min(d))
    else:
        m=0

    M.add(m)

print(min(M), end="")

@shwetha i never mentioned that your program is in correct. Looks like they have set a time limit for the browser to return the answer. and they might have given more numbers and the browser is not returning the answer within the stipulated time and hence your programming though correct, since it could not give the answer within the stipulated time is failing in execution.

I looked at the page html code and found this interesting piece. Dont know weather it is applicable for this portion or not.




var regConfirmationMsg = "Thank you for registering for the course. Click the Announcements tab for important information.";
      if(window.location.hash == '#registration_confirmation') {
        cbShowMsg(regConfirmationMsg);
        setTimeout(function() {cbHideMsg();}, 20000);
      }


The time out function is set to 20 seconds. This could mean if your browser could get the answer in 20 seconds your answer will be evaluated other wise no.

The program is straight and simple. develop a program with the logic given considering how many students are there. i explained two test cases. step by step how the result is obtained. by solving in this process i am able to pass all the three private test cases.

after taking input n,m where n is the no of marks and m is the no of students. dont read the marks from the browser instead assign randomly 100 marks and compile the program and see how much time it takes to solve and see if the browser can wait and give the result.

Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
if there are many iterations the browser may not wait until your program completes the execution. we dont know how many marks they have kept in private cases. So keep the program simple.

import itertools n,m=num=list(map(int, input().split())) num= [x for x in range(100)] diff=[max(x)-min(x) for x in itertools.permutations(num,m)] print(min(diff),end=)

run the above program and see what happens in the browser. i have assigned 100 marks for num instead of taking the input from the browser. The browser is not waiting until the loop is completed. so keep the problem simple.

dont try to eliminate the duplicates. your are not supposed to eliminate them. Program is straight forward. just sort the marks and go over the loop as indicated in the page below.

your program is absolutely perfect and have no issues. since the browser is not waiting for more than 30 seconds or one minute you are seeing the issues.
since the difference has to be minimized, the numbers are to be close enough so by sorting and selecting the numbers by going in a sequence from beginning to end will reduce the no of iterations .

I dont understand what are you trying to show here. Use print statements after every line and see if your program is behaving the way you desired.

Reply 5 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
What i understand is they might have given a wait time for the browser to calculate the answer. if the browser calculate the answer within the time it will check the answer with the expected output and gives the result. other wise it will fail the test case.

Since you are using two for loops, it could be taking time and the browser killed your problem After we have sorted the marks, and when you are selecting values each time , dont you think the first one is your min and the last one is your maximum. value With just one for loop we can achieve this. with in the loop each time just find the difference between the last one and first one and append the values to a list and print the min of the list.

Excel based VBA is a powerful tool for webscrapping you could see many examples in youtube. I worked on few projects for almost one year automating the stuff. we had excellent out put. since i had the experience i understood it is not as easy as they are showing in the video. Issue comes with internet speed. code will be running very fast from the program before the browser refreshes. I was not much interested to learn and dig into what is going on here. but out of curiosity what i tried is this and it worked Since manual intervention is required to scan the code, after it shows the list of our contacts i manually clicked on one of my friend and then allowed the program to send 50 messages to my friend. it has done the job quite well. to stop the code until i clicked on my friends name, i asked python to ask for user input string. the program waited for input from me. than i clicked on my friends name and then gave the an input string and the program gave 50 messages to my friend in whats app. You need to use wait for some seconds depending on your internet speed to send 50 messages, here is my code. from selenium import webdriver from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import WebDriverWait from selenium.webdriver.support import expected_conditions as EC from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By import time driver=webdriver.Firefox("C:\\Users\\write\\Downloads\\geckodriver.exe") driver.get("https://web.whatsapp.com/") s=input("enter any string after you have clicked on your friend's name") for i in range(50): wait=WebDriverWait(driver,600) input_box.send_keys(string+Keys.ENTER) since i didnot have much experience with selenium i didnot try further. if you are interested you may dig furthe using google.. </pre?

You have to extract the file from zip file to your computer and place it in any of your folder and give the path of the driver.

I consider Excel VBA based web-scrapping much helpful than python chrome based web-scrapping. Automation is very helpful when you have to do tasks repeatedly. With Excel you can have your data in coloums and get the data back into coloums.

remove all the other code and just get the browser opened and in it get the whatsapp.com page opened. The entire code is not working. once you get the first two lines set right i will give you other code which you can play with <pre> driver=webdriver.Chrome("C:/Users/USER-PC/Downloads/chromedriver_win32.exe") driver.get("https://web.whatsapp.com/") is the name of your chrome driver after extracting it from zip file chromedriver_win32 than add .exe as shown above for me \\ worked. i am not sure if / works. <\pre>

you have not extracted the chormedriver from the zip file. you need to extract the file into the folder first. double click on the zip file and either extract or copy the exe file onto any of your folders.

matplotlib is used to plot latitude longitude position on maps. this should be true why is it marked incorrect?

To my understanding matplotlib plots only graphs. but not on google maps. gmplot only does that. some one may give a better answer
