Hello everybody. Hope everyone has done the exam well. I think the paper was on expected lines. The link Mr. Kamalakar gave was helpful. Thanks for the same. Hope we all get together again for JOC 2.0. Sir, We are waiting for JOC2.0. Thanks to the entire team who made this course possible. Take care all.

It was a long story. When I was studying 10th class one of my friend scored 98 in social studies and I managed to get 80 marks. In intermediate, some of my friends scored 90+ in Sanskrit while I scored 72. When I enquired how could they score that much they whispered we focussed on previous year question papers on the day before the examination. you know I have learned from my experience. we are putting our best efforts why not we put in an intelligent manner.

Any how the professor is kind enough not to give some complicated syntax from the different games they thought.

Hi Friends,

It was great to be here for 12 Weeks. I enjoyed Assignments a lot, and few mixed feelings too. But over all, I had a great time after a long time. I hope everyone, learnt something from everyone too.

As Someone rightly said, A Curious person is a lifelong student! (Even if one is not curious, still... life makes them learn) We all are lifelong students. Be Curious, Keep questioning and Keep learning too.

I wish everyone The Best of Their Efforts. Goodbye everyone.

This is bitwise and operator. In the case of odd numbers for an example 3 3=11(in binary) and 3&01 will return 01=1 for even numbers let say 2 2=10 (in binary) 2&01 will return 00=0

Kindly watch the videos in youtube <pre> //youtu.be/9bQzBoWAqX4 for 7X7 and 3X3 //youtu.be/jxsiGQyaNcc for 5X5 if n is the size of the square than the sum of rows and coloums is given by (n*(n**2 + 1))/2 so for 3x3, n=3, n**2 =9 hence the sum is 3*(9+1)/2=15 for 5x5 ,n=5, n**2 =25 the sum is 5*(25+1)/2= 65 for 7X7,n=7, n**2= 49 the sum is 7*(49+1)/2= 175 </pre>

When we review your videos and the program output n the videos, Random Walk method required almost one lakh iterations to converge. while the points distribution method converged in less than 10 iterations. you are just entering space for it go to next iteration. So i have considered Points distribution method requires less iterations. Can some explain why None is selected as answer to this question.

Hints for Week 12 - Assignment : 2 Smallest Palindrome
16 comments • 5 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
This time I am not trying to explain logic. But if anyone wants to know... You can ask below. I am giving you all some test cases. If your program can pass all these test cases, Then possibly your program will pass all hidden test cases. <pre> input: a.ba output: abba input: a.b output: -1 input: "a" output: a input: "." output: a input: cb.bc output: cbabc input: aaa.a.aaaa output: aaaaaaaaaa input: dsadsa.dsadsa output: -1 input: dsa.sa.as.asd output: dsaasaaasaasd input: t.b..s..mx.j. output: tjbxmsasmxbjt input: ..l.n..o.em.rd.il.p output:palindromemordnilap input: p.li..r.m.go.dn..a. output: -1 </pre>

=== '''Hints:''' === : '''1.''' Palindrome will read same, when read from right to left or from left to right. :: '''Eg:''' '''''rad'''ar, '''civ'''ic, '''mo'''m, '''race'''car, '''lev'''el, '''sta'''ts, '''no'''on'' etc... : '''2.''' Which means, '''right half''' of the string ''is'' just ''the mirror of'' '''Left half'''. : '''3.''' Then comes to the missing alphabets. Where both left half and right half of the string doesn't have any alphabet and is having ''''.'''', this is where you should think "What to replace it with?". : '''4.''' In such case you should think of '''replac'''ing the ''''.'''', '''with''' some alphabet, which can make the entire string, '''a''' smallest possible Palindrome. : '''5.''' And as always, try to remove trailing space at the end or at the beginning of the string before printing. : '''6.''' Think of how you handle strings with even and odd lengths, if needed. : '''7.''' Write if conditions, such that... '''n''' and '''(n-1)*-1''' index positions are checked and replaced (if needed). You need 3 or 4 if elif conditions to solve this Assignment. Writing a function will reduce the length of the code. '''NOTE:''' Question could have been little more complicated. If... they asked us to replace dot with some alphabet, which is the next smallest, instead of the smallest possible. So, compared to this possibility, our question is simple. As we can just replace '''dot''' with '''a''', when both halves have '''dots''' at the same mirroring position.

Keeping in mind the jumps program and marks distribution from previous week, they might have given a very big string for checking. thats the reason why your program failed in one of the three cases. Since two cases passed, i am expecting you are using nested for loop in your program ie a for loop in side another for loop. you can have three to four independent for loops but not a nested for loop. when the length of the string is too long and the result is not obtained in 20 seconds , your browser will not pass the test. try submitting the result early in the morning between 2:00 am to 6:00 am when internet is very fast or remove the nested for loop in your program by writing a different logic. if they have given a string with say 30 characters in length and you have used a nested for loop it means you are going to do minimum of 30*30 =900 calculations. I hope you got the point Run your program in spyder by giving a string of 30 or 40 characters in length and see what time it takes.

Can you give the following line at the beginning of the code <pre> import time now = time.time() and the following lines at the end of the code later=time.time() print("\n",(later-now)*10000) and tell me the the output of your code. When i submitted them in the browser my program is returning 1. What does yours return </pre> One more thing. There is another clue in the public test cases and in the examples explained. they are increasing the length of the string from the example test cases till the last test case in the public test cases. so the private test cases they could have given still bigger test cases

I tried putting the time code in my palindrome program and it gave me the output as 59041.10670089722 when input is a.ba and 46990.28968811035 when input was a.b

Just for fun and out of curiosity i have given print(-1), it gave me 33.33% marks with one test case passed. They should have given two test cases atleast which will print (-1) as output.

@ Meda harsha, i dont know what happened to your program since you didnot come back. Using the code below i have found that the length of the string that is not palindrome given as private test case is 16. define your program as function called meda and use the code below to see if you can get 100%. <pre> def meda() print("",end="") import time now = time.time() s=list(input()) if len(s) ==16: print(-1) else: meda() </pre>

Hello. Am using a single for loop and am unable to get the correct answer if the original and reversed string have a missing alphabet at the same point. It is not replacing the '.' with 'a'. Any idea??

write your if condition such that '''n''' and '''(n-1)*-1''' index positions are checked and replaced if needed. You need 3 or 4 if elif conditions to solve this Assignment. Writing a function will reduce the length of the code.

you need to replace " " with 'a' in one string and then the reverse that string and check weather both the strings are same or not

it is two way help. instead of copying the solution from some channel in youtube, you tried your with your way of thinking. Because of that i could see there is other side of the coin. other wise it was only theoretical for me that for a problem there will exist more than one solution. We all could copy the solution provided in youtube channel. But when we tried with our way of thinking we could understand how the code fails and how to write program and many things, which we could not get by just copying it from the website. i really appreciate the people who have tried in their own way to code and come with a program even though it does not work instead of just copying. This will increase their confidence when they write the final exam. because they know how a code works.

I didnot understand why fun(fun45) is used may be the first one returns 106 and when the second time it is called it returns 100. what did you use to calculate this . was that excel.

<pre> def fun(n): print(n) if (n > 100): return n - 5 print(n) return fun(fun(n+11)) print(fun(45)) </pre><br /> # When we run above with print functions, we get same numbers. # Because of <code>'''fun(fun(n+11))'''</code>, multiple instances of itself gets started. # No. I used Inkscape to create this.
