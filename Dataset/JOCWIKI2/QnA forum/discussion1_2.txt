Incorrect accepted answer for question 2 of assignment 1
8 comments • ‪7 months ago‬




‪Hiren (talkcontribs)‬
‪The question 2 of assignment 1 (whose scores were declared after midnight) reads as follows:‬

‪Which of the following constructs carries out a set of instructions as long as any key in the keyboard is pressed?‬

‪In other words, the question is asking for a construct which will do something while a key is kept pressed.‬

‪However, the accepted answer to the question is the "repeat until" construct, which is not accurate, because that construct will automatically keep doing something until (not '"as long as"') a key is actually pressed. The construct is worded as "repeat until", not "repeat as long as". I hope the difference is clear. This can be practically verified in Scratch as well.‬
‪Another analogy which can be made is that the question is asking for a "while" loop, whereas the accepted answer is something which is equivalent to "do....while not". Once again, I hope the difference is clear.‬

‪The question is asking for a construct which should stop executing the instructions when the key is no longer pressed, whereas the accepted answer is something which will actually stop carrying out the instructions when a key is indeed pressed. So the correct accepted answer should have been "None of the above", which I had submitted. Please re-evaluate this. I was given 0 points for this question.‬

‪I am sorry I cannot understand how you can consider 'until' and 'as long as' to mean the same. Let me give another example. Suppose you are at a traffic signal. Should you be saying "Vehicles must stop as long as the light is red" or "Vehicles must stop until the light is red"?‬

‪Simran (talkcontribs)‬
‪You can take it otherwise too. If i say repeat move 10 steps until space key is pressed and i keep on pressing key 'd' as long as the cat is moving, still repeat until is valid here. It all depends on the condition supplied.‬
‪Reply‬
‪7 months ago‬



‪Hiren (talkcontribs)‬
‪In case of this question, it is asked as follows: "as long as any key in the keyboard is pressed" . So the condition supplied is not for first keeping key 'd' pressed and then pressing 'space' to signal termination. It is applicable to all keys. The question is saying that irrespective of whatever key you press, the execution should keep running.‬

‪In fact, if I use your example, I can even say that the "move 10 steps" should continue even after the space key is pressed, because even this case (of pressing the space key) comes under the words used in the question, i.e. "as long as any key in the keyboard is pressed". So the movement of the sprite (as per the question asked) should not stop even after the space key is pressed.‬

‪Rajiv sarkar (talkcontribs)‬
‪Actually whenever you write a print statement in Python, it automatically shifts the cursor to the next line. That is why if you write another print statement, the output is automatically printed on the next line. If you don't want that, you have to explicitly say that insert nothing after print statement. The end command with empty string does that only.‬

‪The presentation error comes because whenever you write a print statement, it writes that thing inside the bracket, but with that, the cursor goes to the next line automatically. That is why presentation error is coming. To stop the cursor to go to the next line, you should write print("Anything, but don't go to next line", end="") After that if you write another print statement, then the statement will be printed at the end of previous statement and not on next line.‬

‪Whatever you write inside input, it gets printed on screen so that user will know what the computer wants. After that user will enter something through keyboard that will store it in the variable. Eg. name=input ('enter your name : ') Enter your name gets printed on screen. If user enters Rohan and then press enter, then variable 'name' will become Rohan. If you instead enter a=3, the name will become "a=3" . Hope it helps :)‬

‪If you write name = Amit Verma, it will think that name is Amit but Verma is a different thing. So to connect that you have to use underscore. No other symbol is permitted in variable name.

Stability of programming language

‪If programming languages are evolving at the current rate , can we expect a time when we don't have to do any programming but the computer will become smart enough to understand our language?Like if we say the computer to make an addition , it will simply ask for the numbers to be added and give the sum ie the computer will itself write the program in it's memory and run the program. and if C++ is much more user friendly than C ,why are we still learning the primitive language?.

‪Rajiv sarkar (talkcontribs)‬
‪We are learning C because it is the most efficient language, it is often called middle level language rather than higher level language. That is the reason when speed and memory are the utmost important thing in our program, we have no option but to write program in C. When we learn C, it teaches us not only programming but how numbers are stored in memory, how lists actually work, how we can locate variables using memory address. So, python is one of the most user friendly language, but that does not allows us to talk to machines in their language. If we instruct machines in their language, they will understand the instruction fast enough. That is why C is still being used and will not die till a long time. Though it is true that we should start learning programming with some simple language like python, so that we can focus more on building projects rather than finding error in our code, and later on we should learn advanced language like C. But most of the colleges in India teach C and not Python. And yes, someday we can hope computer will be that intelligent, but still that day is very far. But much work is being done in this field of machine learning and artificial intelligence, the best example is alexa or Google home, or Google now. Think about it :)‬

‪Dear Sir/Ma'am, How to pass all the test cases together? I have written : a = int(input(10)) But through this code, I can pass a single test case only. What should I write in order to pass all the test cases together?‬
‪Reply‬

‪Simran (talkcontribs)‬
‪You have to take user input. Write a=int(input()). You cant write separate programs for every input. When you will run this program, it will ask you for input. You can give different inputs and check your program.‬

‪I learnt python basics through a wonderful book named "Think Python 2 - How to think like a computer scientist" . This book covers basic to advanced python. It is available for free. Search for it in Google for pdf version. This is the link to download the ebook. Another great book is Python Beginner to Advanced manuscript. Search for this is amazon, the kindle version is free to download.‬

‪Yes actually when I started learning, Jio was not there and then we used to have 1 Gb Internet for 250 Rs for a month. So watching YouTube videos to learn anything was out of question. So I learnt it through book and practice, with some competitive coding on hackerrank. Though after that too, YouTube helped a lot to learn all the functionalities of python, which makes it so easy to do anything, like everything has a built-in function.‬

Python Vs Matlab

‪sir i'm very curious to learn python as well as matlab , can't figure out which one is better or more useful .!? and does the course really require basic knowledge of c++ or something cause i keep hearing this thing from others ? if not the course then does it give one an edge knowing c++ and then learning python for real life problems ?.

‪Rajiv sarkar (talkcontribs)‬
‪Depends on what you want to do, if you want to do image processing and doing calculations with matrices or so, then MATLAB is used, but the popularity of Matlab is not increasing now, because of the fact that Python and its libraries are free to use, but MATLAB is very costly. Only large organisations can use MATLAB due to its cost. Python on the other hand can be used to do a lot of things, big data analytics, machine learning, Web development, etc. If you are a beginner, go with python, learn it well, from beginner level to advanced level, do some amazing projects with it. If you do this, then learning a new language after that will be a child's play for you.‬

‪Reply‬
‪8 months ago‬



‪Rajiv sarkar (talkcontribs)‬
‪Automation control & mobility systems are past terms. These are rapidly merging with Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). So, due to this, earlier FBD, Labview and Matlab language were used but because of this paradigm shift, the languages now being used are Pythkn, C python and Java. Although the shift is slow but it is visible everywhere.‬

‪It is often said, if you have extra time, like a week or so and have never done programming before, it is good to learn scratch because it introduces you to basic programming concepts like loops and if-else conditions in an interactive way. If you have done programming before, scratch is then not required.‬

‪Simran (talkcontribs)‬
‪Presentation error occurs when actual output is not same as the expected one. print command automatically adds newline at the end so you need to write print(a,end=""). It changes the end character and makes it Null.‬
