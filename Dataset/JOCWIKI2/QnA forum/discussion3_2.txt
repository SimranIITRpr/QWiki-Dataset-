Just to add, if we write a python code, to get the jumble word for SIT. Then on of the option does comes out to be "SIT" itself, apart from the other 5 ways. So, I think 6 might be an appropriate answer to the asked question.

Yes and SIT has been given in the question. So 5 is the appropriate answer. You need to jumble SIT. Jumble means some rearrangement must happen. SIT is not rearranged version of SIT.

This code is a customized and improvised code. I have added few extra functions like clear screen, sleep, and 3 chances. I used functions everywhere possible, to reduce the length of the program. And also, I have added a condition to random, so that we will never get a unjumbled output.
This link will take you to the Week-3 SuperNotes. Just now finished testing and posting. Very rarely it makes us loose a chance, I still dont know why it is doing like that. But no problem, as we have 2 more chances.
Feel free to ask any questions related to that Jumbled word program from the Super Notes.

Solutions of Week 3, Assignment 1, 2, 3, and Quiz Question "SIT" too (flipping if interested). Please understand the code before copying.

Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
NOTE: Copying the code without understanding will never help you learn. Please ask questions, if you don't understand. Everyone here wants you to learn.

Assignment-3: Digits
Question: You are given a number A which contains only digits 0's and 1's. Your task is to make all digits same by just flipping one digit (i.e. 0 to 1 or 1 to 0 ) only. If it is possible to make all the digits same by just flipping one digit then print YES else print NO.

NOTE: Expected output is checking only for YES or NO, and not for flipping. Still if anyone is curious to know, please check the 2nd code below. I used only str() and str operations. This could be one of the possibilities.

CODE:
A = str(input())
if A.count('0')==1 or A.count('1')==1:
  print("YES", end="")
else:
  print("NO", end="")

Flipping 0 and 1
In the Below code, I have tried to use only string operations and a function to flip the numbers. Possibly there could be more simple solutions available. still this is what my brain can think of for now.

NOTE: Don't use below code for Assignment. This flip code is not necessary for assignment. Expected output is only Yes or NO.

CODE:
a = str(input())
def flip(i):
        f_a = a[:a.index(i)]
        if i=='0':
            f_a = f_a+'1'
        else:
            f_a = f_a+'0'
        f_a = f_a+a[a.index(i)+1:]
        return f_a

if a.count('0') == 1:
    flipped_a = flip('0')
    print(flipped_a,"YES")
    
elif a.count('1') == 1:
    flipped_a = flip('1')
    print(flipped_a,"YES")
    
else:
    print("NO")

I did this mistake too. It is not 6, it should be 5.
The question is 
If the word in your mind is SIT, in how many ways can you pose the jumbled question?

Yes, it is a permutations question. so answer is 6, But read on....
Calculation goes this way SIT is 3 letters. So we call it as three factorial. (3!)
It should be solved as 3 x 2 x 1 = 6 which gives 6 as Answer.
But, As per the question, "In how may ways we can ask the jumbled question."

So we should exclude the right answer. Which means 6-1 = 5

There are more ways to solve any problem. Here are three ways to solve this. 1. Using append() and 2. using remove()

NOTE: Below code will be faster, because it doesn't need to copy, and then remove.

1. My CODE: Using append().

    B.append(i)

print(*B, sep=" ", end="")

print(*b, sep=' ', end="")

3. CODE: using del
Thanks AA, for making me and others think in other ways and possibilities. We can try this way too. But here we are using del and deleting from the end, using index numbers. That is why we are using range.

A = [int(i) for i in input().split(" ")]

for i in range(len(A)-1, -1, -1):
    if A[i]%3==0:
       del A[i]

Programming Assignment 1: we know that max() and min() help us to give the minimum and maximum elements. When I take the first list (Test case 1)and displayed the min and max values, it says that, the first answer is correct. But the others are wrong. When all the four lists are taken and all for min and max values are displayed, it says it is wrong. Just I want to know to present the output of different test cases

Hi Arunkumar, Thank you for your response. I have seen your code. I need to know how the first line a = list(map(int,input().split())) of your code gets executed in the Max and Min program. Also I am interested to know about the working principle of the last line print(*B, sep=" ", end="") in the multiples of 3 and 5 program. Also I need help of first line of the third program Flipping a = str(input()).

Sorry for late reply Lucknesh. My free time is in the night. Thanks for asking. I did the same mistake while practising.

1st error in the logic is to use remove().
If we keep removing and checking same List variable, program will skip(in a way) some numbers. Because of remove() few numbers got skipped the checking process of "if condition", as numbers at the index numbers are changed, and output is as below.
For 2 3 4 5 6 output is 2 5.
For 21 47 32 43 output is 32 43.
For 8 9 6 5 3 output is 8 5.
Is it working, if you are not using end="" in the print function?

Here also same problem. Why you want to remove and append?
Once of c.remove(i) and b.append(i) is a unnecessary step. You are just creating duplicates. Both c and b have same data.
You don't need 3 Variables for this to work.
I think you forgot to remove print(c).
Your code should be as below.

a=list(map(int,input().split()))
b=a.copy()
for i in a:
   if (i%3==0):
       b.remove(i)
print(*b, sep=' ')

The if loop in this code terminates the very first instance it encounters a multiple of 3, and spits out whatever remains in the list. How can I make the loop check all the elements of the list. What am I missing.

A = [int(i) for i in input().split(" ")] for i in A:

   if i%3==0:
       A.remove(i)       
print (*A, sep=" ", end="")

AA, We at least need to lists to solve this. Using a little lengthy process, we might can get it done with just one list. So i suggest you to use two lists as in the above examples. or try to create a list, which hold index values of all 3 multiples and delete them from the end. instead of beginning.

* The way you are converting input to '''int''' using <code>list(map())</code> will remove ''00'' from ''0011'', or any string passed to it, which has zeros in the beginning. * In the above code Change <code>print("NO")</code> to <code>print("NO", end="")</code> * Other than that there is another errors too. Your code will work only if there is one Zero in the input. (Based on my first point, you know why) * '''Your code will not work because of 1st line.'''

@Lwardell it is possible because the way we pass our input in Spyder could be different. By Checking your code we can understand that. It also depends on how you handled your Data types too. Best way to avoid such problems (based on my experiences) is to convert our variables to a specific data type, which will work for the scenario. In my case I changed all to strings for Assignment 3.

Which of the following can be an output of random.randint(1,1000) but can never be an output of random.randrange(1,1000) ? would it be 1000?

If the word in your mind is SIT, in how many ways can you pose the jumbled question? i think the answer would be 5

permutation is n! so 3!= 6 (SIT,STI,ITS,IST,TIS,TSI)

but question is like that its saying except sit how many words you can get then you are getting 5

But if we write the code, we are separating the letters and then joining them ; so it is possible that we join those in original sequence also,I think.

=== I did this mistake too it is not <s>6</s>, it is '''5'''. === The question is <br />'''If the word in your mind is SIT, in how many ways can you pose the jumbled question?''' * Yes, it is a permutations question. so answer is 6, But read on.... *: Calculation goes this way SIT is 3 letters. So we call it as three factorial. (3!) *: It should be solved as <code>3 x 2 x 1 = 6</code> which gives '''6''' as Answer. But, As per the question, '''"In how may ways we can ask the jumbled question."''' '''So we should exclude the right answer. Which means <code>6-1 = 5</code>'''<br />

Respected Sir/Madam, i followed the programming steps taught in FizzBuzz videos.But my doubt is when the 'LINE 1 if statement' is written somewhere in the place of LINE 2 or LINE 3 statements, we get either Fizz or Buzz printed in the console but not FizzBuzz. def FizzBuzz(r): for i in range(1,r): if(i%3==0 and i%5==0): #LINE 1 print(str(i)+" FizzBuzz") else: if(i%3==0): #LINE 2 print(str(i)+" Fizz") else: if(i%5==0): #LINE 3 print(str(i)+" Buzz") else: print(str(i)) #END OF THE PROGRAM I tried to run the below program, but couldnt. Dont understand where Im going wrong.Kindly help. def FizzBuzz(r): for i in range(1,r): if(i%3==0): #LINE 2 print(str(i)+" Fizz") else: if(i%3==0 and i%5==0): #LINE 1 print(str(i)+" FizzBuzz") else: if(i%5==0): #LINE 3 print(str(i)+" Buzz") else: print(str(i))

Som (talkcontribs)
Hey, The problem here is that firstly you will always have to check for multiples of 15 i.e. you will have to keep "if(i%3==0 and i%5==0)" in LINE 1 always because if you place this after "if(i%3==0)" or "if(i%5==0)" then what happens is that these conditions also become true if you encounter a multiple of 15 and then the counter doesn't move further and stops after executing the statements within these conditions. NOTE: If the 'if' condition becomes true then the 'else' part is not checked

@madmax i think its our habit to treat 1001 or something written using digits as number. the question asked was to flip a single digit and get all same. so it does not make any difference if we treat 0 and 1 as character and then apply our logic to check the condition

You can use while loop. <pre> l=[] while True: in=input() if in=="": break else: l.append(int(in)) </pre>

You cannot directly assign value to list like mylist[0]=something because at first, there is no element and it will give an index error.

sir,a number which is divisible by 3 and 5 .that number must divisible by 15 so we can write if (i%3==0 and i %5==0 and i%15==0).

There is no need to add third condition i.e. divisibility by 15 then.
