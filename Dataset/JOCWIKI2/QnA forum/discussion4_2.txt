Programming Assignment-2: End-Sort - Test Case 3
16 comments • 6 months ago
Koushik Kamalahasan (talkcontribs)
Programming Assignment-2: End-Sort Due on 2019-03-07, 23:59 IST Given a list A of N distinct integer numbers, you can sort the list by moving an element to the end of the list. Find the minimum number of moves required to sort the list using this method in ascending order.

Input Format: The first line of the input contains N distinct integers of list A separated by a space.

Output Format Print the minimum number of moves required to sort the elements.

Example:

Input: 1 3 2 4 5

Output: 3

Explanation: In the first move, we move 3 to the end of the list. In the second move, we move 4 to the end of the list, and finally, in the third movement, we move 5 to the end.

Hi all,

I am trying to do the above assignment. Below is my code:

A=input().split(" ") N=len(A) count = 0

app = 0 j=0

while (j<=N):

   for i in range(j, N-1):
       if(A[j] > A[i+1]):
           app = 1
           
   if (app == 1):
       temp=A[j]
       del A[j]
       A.append(temp)
       count +=1
       app=0
       
   else:
       j=j+1
print(count, end="")


My code works fine for the given above example and also for the first two test cases (with input as 1,2,3,4,5 and 1,3,5,2,6)

For the third test case (with input as 5,1,3,2,7) I am getting the number of moves as 5 and not 3.

I tried it manually and I am getting 5 moves. Below is my manual moves: Given Array	5	1	3	2	7 Step 1 - Move 5 to the end	1	3	2	7	5 Step 2- Move 3 to the end	1	2	7	5	3 Step 3 - Move 7 to the end	1	2	5	3	7 Step 4 - Move 5 to the end	1	2	3	7	5 Step 5 - Move 7 to the end	1	2	3	5	7

Can someone help me and let me know where I am wrong?

Thanks Koushik

no, move 3 to the end first, then 5, then 7. thats it. 3 steps.

For the third test case with input as 5,1,3,2,7

Aren't we suppose to move the first number ('5') we come across which is greater than the next number ('1') in the list to the end of the list?

Reply 7 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
but if we move 5 first, but then when we move 3... 5 should be moved again. that means we added an extra step. condition is to use less moves to sort, and that too by moving to the last.

how do I tell the computer that 3 needs to be moved first to the end of the list

Reply 7 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
Still i am failing one of the hidden tests. but for your question, i can share a logic.

NOTE: Maybe experienced or smarter person can come up with a different solution. This is just one of many possibilities.

As a human, we can see a sorted list in our brain before sorting something. That is what led to my approach. so, I am using a sorted list as reference only.
Then I used index numbers to check if a number is on the left instead of right?
For example

Lets say 2 is at index 1, and 3 is at the index 0.
Then there is a problem. they are not sorted.
Your question is, how do we say 3 is 1st. Based on my human approach. in a sorted list, the next unsorted number would be 3.

In 5 1 3 2 7, 1 and 2 doesn't need to be moved, because 2 is on the right side of the 1.
Then we should move to next smallest number, 3.
Is 3 on the right side of 2?
If not! Move, and so on...
5 1 2 7 3
1 2 7 3 5
1 2 3 5 7

Thanks for the reply.

I found the first lowest and second lowest (here 1 and 2) compared the position and if required moved the second lowest to the end (here it is not moved). I am struck in finding the third lowest and so on... I am still working on it

Code is in a Bare Bones state:
#A=list(map(int,input().split()))
A=[1,3,2,4,5]
#A=[1,5,6,3,7,8,2]
#A=[1,3,2,4,5]
B=sorted(A)
moves=0
if (len(A) > 1):
    for i in range(len(B)-1):
        print(B[i],B[i+1])
        if(A.index(B[i]) > A.index(B[i+1])):
            A.append(B[i+1])
            A.remove(B[i+1])
            moves=moves+1
            print(B[i+1],"is not on the right side of",B[i],
                  "! kicking it from left to right.")
            print(A)

print(moves, end="")

This is the basic code I created. But this will not work completely for the assignment. You should work on this code to make it work on all possible test cases.
Possibly, you can take Idea from this and create your own code.

Write a loop which will go through the indexes in such a way that, they will cover the list from 0 till n

Lets say above list index range is 0 - 4
write a loop which will generate numbers and 2 variables will take the increment and then, checking processes will run on those two variables.
for i in range(len(list)):
     j=i+1
     print(i,j)

OR use two loops where one loop stays at 0 and second loop checks with all elements in the list.
Then 1st loop will increment to 1 and 2nd loop checks with rest of the elements, etc...
for i in range(len(list)):
     for j in range(len(list)):
          print("Inner Loop",i,j)
     print("Outer Loop",i,j)

   A[i] = int (A[i])
   
count = 0 lowest = A[0] lowest2 = None for i in range (1, N-count):

   if A[i] < lowest:  
       lowest2 = lowest 
       lowest = A[i]  
   elif lowest2 == None or lowest2 > A[i]:  
       lowest2 = A[i]  
for n in range (N-1):

   lowest_pos = A.index(lowest)
   lowest2_pos = A.index(lowest2)
   if lowest_pos > lowest2_pos :
       temp=A[lowest2_pos]
       A.remove(temp)
       A.append(temp)
       count=count+1
   
   nlowest = lowest
   nlowest2 = lowest2
   for i in range (1, N):    
       if A[i] > nlowest2:
           lowest = A[i]
           lowest2 = None
           break
       
   for k in range(N):
       if A[k] > nlowest and A[k] < lowest:  
           lowest2 = lowest 
           lowest = A[k]  
       elif lowest2 == None or lowest2 > A[k]:  
           lowest2 = A[k]  
                 
print(A) print(count,end="")

We need to create a basic code and set it in a while loop, which should run till both lists(sorted and unsorted) are same.

A function should be called from outside the function. Try this sample code. and let me know if it doesn't work. Please observe that last two lines in the program are out side of the function. 

def fact(n):
   if n==1 or n==0:
       return(1)
   else:
       return(n*fact(n-1))

You need to initially call the function

Use Fact(5)

Or any number to call the function

can you explain this question? what are the inputs that are to be selected by the random function and which ones should we input?

Reply 7 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
@ AI, Yes, this Assignment was complicated to get the inputs in the 1st place. Yet, after taking some rest, i was able to figure-out a solution. Check my code in the above reply to @Rishi.

Answer for your question is:

Test case 1
5
3
1
6
2
7

Test case 2
3
3
2
1

Test case 3
5
8
1
4
3
6

Explanation: 

The first line of the input is 4. Which means that n is 4, or the number of elements in list_1 is 4. The elements of list_1 are 3, 1, 2, 5 in this order.

The sorted version of this list is 1 2 3 5, which is the output.

MAGIC SQUARE

Can you please tell me where i am going wrong . I have tried to put the elements in the list directly without using another list

def magicsquare(n):

   ms=[]
   for i in range(0,n):
       for j in range(0,n):
             ms[i][j].append(0)
Reply Edited 7 months ago

This is syntactically incorrect in python.
One easy way could be:

ms = [ ]
for i in range(n):

   ms.append([0]*n)

magic_square=[] for i in range(n): l=[] for j in range(n): l.append(0) magic_square.append(l) In your code the indent is not correct. We need to append "l" when the inner for loop ends. But you are appending it inside the inner for loop.

Okay the problem lies here if(p==-1&q==n): In python we cannot use "&" symbol to denote the 'AND' logical operation (we use that in java). Use keyword "and", so the syntax will be: if(p==-1 and q==n): Hope it helps.

The function "sep" does not works like that in a for loop.For instance if we have a print statement like this : print('09','12','2016', sep='-') OUTPUT : 09-12-2016 "sep" works if there are multiple print element in the same block, it separates them with the character provided in sep = "character to separate with" Hope it helps

Reply 7 months ago
Pritish shubham (talkcontribs)
As per my understanding - "it depends on the kind of outcome you want the code to perform". In the above program, you have used 1 for loop for generating matrix and another for loop for printing the matrix. So, accordingly loop was indented. Performing different functionality, loops are indented with similar spatial space. The issue in the "list index out of range: Here "i and j" are the acting as row and column vectors. When you defined "3rd for loop" with same indentation, the "i and j" became undefined because its difficult to define row within row and column within column. This is best to my understanding, as I am not the expert in coding. Please correct me if I am wrong; any one, who can explain this more appropriately is most welcome. Regards

The code need to be corrected for 2 things 1. magic.append(l) - this need to be appended a step forward 2. The last for statement need to be appended for 1 step forward, print() need to be appended 1 step forward and the last print statement need to be appended 2 step forward. You can use this modified code. def magic_square(n): magicSquare = [] for i in range(n): l = [] for j in range(n): l.append(0) magicSquare.append(l) i = n // 2 j = n - 1 num = n * n count = 1 while (count <= num): if (i == -1 and j == n): j = n - 2 i = 0 else: if (j == n): j = 0 if (i < 0): i = n - 1 if (magicSquare[i][j] != 0): j = j - 2 i = i + 1 continue else: magicSquare[i][j] = count count += 1 i = i - 1 j = j + 1 for i in range(n): for j in range(n): print(magicSquare[i][i], end=" ") print() print("the sum of each row/column/diagonal is: " + str(n * (n ** 2 + 1) / 2)) magic_square(3)
