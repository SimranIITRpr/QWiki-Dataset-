Note: Hello friends please share your programs too, if you have a better code or different approach than these programs. Everyone, who struggled to finish assignments, please ask you questions here. So that we all can learn and help each-other, and you may no need any help in future to solve similar challenges.

Assignment 1: I tried to do with list approach; hole0=[] hole2=[] hole1=[] count=[] try1=("CEFGHIJKLMNSTUVWXYZ") try2=("ADOPQR") try3=("B") for letter in try1:

   hole0.append(letter)
print (hole0)
for letter in try2:

   hole1.append(letter)
for letter in try3:

   hole2.append(letter)
def hole_no(word):

   if word in hole0:
       count.append(0)
   elif word in hole1:
       count.append(1)
   elif word in hole2:
       count.append(2)
   else:
       print("Input Error")
       
a=input() for i in a:

   hole_no(i)
print(sum(count))

Assignment 3: import string

list1=[] list2=[] count1=[] count2=[] for i in range(len(string.ascii_lowercase)):

   list1.append(string.ascii_uppercase[i])
   list2.append(string.ascii_lowercase[i])    
def bike_ride(word):

   if word in list1:
       count1.append(1)
   elif word in list2:
       count2.append(1)
   else:
       count2.append(0)        
a=input() for i in a:

   bike_ride(i)
print(sum(count1),sum(count2),end=(""))

@Srirekha, you have any question or you just wanted to share?
you forgot def printDict(): in the 1st line.
and dictionary uses {} brackets. We can simply use d={}
Change print statement a little like this to avoid presentation error, print(d, end="")

I have gotten my code to pass all the examples in Python. Only 1 is passing when I submit. Any suggestions about other issues, besides the indexing issue, that I may be running into?

just use the provided Index number and find the song, then sort the list , and lastly find the new location(index) of the song in the sorted list and print. Thats it.

Assignment 3, Week 6

Sayantoni Chaudhuri (talkcontribs)
Can anyone please explain what basically the question is? I do not seem to get this.

Reply 6 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
At the bottom of the Assignment code area, printDict() is already called.
Our Assignment is to write this function printDict().
Our function should perform these tasks
It should take input into variable n.
then generate a dictionary, which has 1,2,3,...n as keys.
and as values (1,4,9,16,25,...) they should have square roots of the keys.
Example:

Input: 5
Output: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
You just need to write your program in the function printDict()

Reply Edited 6 months ago
Sayantoni Chaudhuri (talkcontribs)
okay so here is my code

def printDict():

 n=int(input())
 d={}
 key=1
 value=1
 for i in range(n):    
   d[key]=value
   key+=1
   value=key*key
   print(d)
which generates an error as follows:

Test Case 1
Wrong Answer Input Expected Output Actual Output

4



{1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}



{1: 1}\n {1: 1, 2: 4}\n {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9}\n {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}\n

what should I do?

Assignment 1, week 6 doubt
37 comments • 6 months ago
Bhavansh (talkcontribs)
I wrote the following code it passed all after compiling the the test but while submitting it shows 0 out of 100 passed.


a=int(input()) arr = [int(x) for x in input().split()] arr1 = sorted(arr) b=int(input()) for i in range (a):

 if arr1[i]==arr[b-1]:
   c=i
print(arr1[c],end="")

Can someone explain me the problem clearly and how can we solve it.

Reply 6 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
@Bhavansh, You got confused with the question. Lets help you understand the question first. In simple words.


      k= 2
         |
    A= 1 3 4 2
      '---.---'
       N= 4

As per the question, there are few songs, say N. Which is 4.
All those songs are unsorted, and are in a playlist A, [1,3,4,2].
One of the songs is your favourite ("Computing Paradox"), and its position in a unsorted list is K, which is 2nd, so the song in unsorted list is 3.
But, if we check the index of 3, it is 1.
Now our task is...
To sort the list A.
Then find the new location, of the song (3), in the list A and print it.
After sorting, the list A will be [1,2,3,4]
The new location (index number) of song 3 is... 2.
I hope, you know how to find the index of a number in the list.
Now it is up to you, to put all of this in a code.

When b is given, you have used b-1. Now you are asked to print C value not a[c]



system uses 0 indexing and we are to report it in 1-indexing so try printing c+1 instead of a[c] and see the result

For this assignment 1, when I compile it shows all are passed but when I submitted it shows 1 out of 3 are passed.In my code I am trying to get the value from k'th position of the unsorted list and after sorting trying to get the index for the value captured in the previous step while taking into consideration 1-indexing. Did anyone get this issue? Also is there any chance of having the list having duplicate values?

Reply 6 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
There are no duplicate values this time. Even if there are any, they are definitely not the number/song, we should be working on. all tests will pass, including hidden.

Reply 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
Your calculations should be based on the assumption 1- indexing. But computer does with zero indexing only. so when they stated kth position in 1-indexing it means k-1 for computer. when computer reports ,it is nth position ie is zero indexing, get it to 1-indexing by adding one. and see what happens. I am not sure if duplicate values are there in the list.

Very good hint. @Bhavansh, @Baijayanta, think on this too. hint is 1-indexing.

Can anyone retify the mistake.

Reply 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
You are not asked to print the value at Kth position. you need to take the value at the kth position and find its position in the sorted list. Remember 1-indexing given for input and output in the statement of the problem while computer uses 0 indexing. you got it right in picking the right number by using l[k-1] now find what is the postion of this value in the sorted list and shift from 0-indexing to 1-indexing

Reply 6 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
l=[]
n=int(input())
l=list(map(int,input().split()))
k=int(input())
print(l[k-1],end="")
It is better to change input to the list l using list()
Now the problem: You are in the right direction, but you missed 2 steps. You haven't sorted the list. Please read my explanation above to understand. After sorting, you should print the new position of the song.
You are printing the song. instead you should print the new location of the song after sorting.

Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
sorry for the delayed reply. I can still see, you are little confused. Let me help you with a different example. as there are numbers involved in the place of songs. you are not getting the logic.


              k= 6
                 |
    l= 1 3 5 2 4 7
      '-----.-----'
         n= 6

Observe this diagram above for you. n is 6 songs.
Now k=6 means 6th number in the unsorted list l=[1,3,5,2,4,7]
Using l[k-1] will give me 7.
But that is not what we want to print. Instead we need to print the location of 7 in the list after sorting.
What will be the sorted list, this l=[1,2,3,4,5,7]
Now you need to find the position of 7 in the sorted list is 6
Now you think and tell me, how to search and get the index number of 7 and make it 6?
using this l.index()?
And the "end=" Should also have a double quotes at the end. end=""

@Lakshmi, Perfect. This is what I was trying to help you understand. we can simplify your code further. You dont need to copy "lis" into "sort". You could just save the number pos=lis[k-1] in a variable "pos" and then sort "lis". At the end print index(pos)+1 of "lis".

Think about this. :)

Quiz Question 3 Recursion and Iteration are Similar Programming Techniques
2 comments • 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
Identical means same in all aspects. Similar means same in some aspects. Two triangles are similar means, their shape is same. Their angles are same But their lengths are not same. The length ratio is same. They need not be identical in all aspects Similarly Recursion and iteration are similar in i) they work in loops . They do a process repeatedly until some base/end condition is satisfied. It means Recursion and Iteration are similar Process. So Answer for Question 3 is True. These issues are coming because English is not our Mother Tongue.

Reply Edited 6 months ago
Subhamohan (talkcontribs)
Both recursion and iteration are structured programming techniques. Both involve in giving the code you write structures, these often involve writing code in blocks such as: Sequence - code executed line by line. Selection - branching statements such as if..then..else, or case. Repetition - iterative statements such as for, while, repeat, loop, do, until. Also both recursion and iteration has single entry and exit points. Both are similar in many aspects. Answer for this question must be true. Though execution of a recursive function involves internal stack, where as iteration doesnot. Except this point both have more similarities. So I request the team to please give clarification regarding this

It is better you copy that .txt file into the folder where you have your .py file. Then in the program/code use the .txt file name without any path. This is how we do in html too. When we are referring a file which is in same directory as .html file, we no need to type the entire path.

Possibly, Only problem would be, "File path" as it is OS specific. To avoid it, you can just put your external files like .txt, .wav or any external file, in the same directory where your .py file is. Unless we use "sys" Module and few other similar modules which depend on OS. As per my understanding, using latest version of python will not cause such problems. Because they(Python team) are trying to become OS independent.

; Is WhatsApp group really needed? Why don't we use Telegram for group. : '''My reason is:''' The last time i checked, in WhatsApp groups, there is no privacy, because everyone's cell numbers are open for every member in the group. : More over, WhatsApp is too open and has become a very personal thing. Users have their family photos as their profile pics, and their cell number is linked with so many other things these days. : <u>Is it necessary for a student to give-up their personal information, just to ask a doubt? </u> : But in Telegram, cell numbers are not visible. It is up to the user to make it public or not. : This is just my opinion.

The '''Sole Purpose''' of the wiki was to give our course learners a new and engaging way of learning, a dynamic and interactive way of learning, a simple and robust way of learning. This might also turn out as a gold mine for researchers, although that was not the primary purpose. <br/> '''WhatsApp''' is introduced for the very reason of increasing the required social factor which will help our open minded students build connections in real world. The discussions around our research areas, course structure, improvements will have the long term gains which are not limited to JOCWiki alone. Very few individuals do not wish their contacts to be shared and it's quite understood of them not joining the group for their own personal reasons. <br/> And we respect that. <br/> <br/> Why not Telegram : Above app is pretty popular :D

Is there next level of course offered by the professor in Joy of computing next semester.

Doubt in Quiz Assignment of Week 5
3 comments • 6 months ago
Tej115 (talkcontribs)
I know this might be a little late to ask a doubt, but to convert a .wav file to text, we import the library "speech_recognition". But in Week 5 Quiz assignment, when the same question is asked, "SpeechRecognition" is given to be the right choice. Isn't it supposed to be "None of the above"? I know that the only thing missing is an underscore (neglecting the part where 's' in speech and 'r' in recognition must be in lower case), but then the whole syntax will be wrong, right? Well, even importing of library files won't be done correctly.

I am seeing big big programs posted in User Notes. Are we supposed to create such big programs in the end exam also. It takes atleast 4 to 5 hours of continuous thinking , coding and debugging and getting the programming to work. I hope we will not see such big programs in the End. Exam

Week 6 Assignment 1. 1-indexing means what
3 comments • 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
In Assignment 1 , 1-indexing is used. What does this mean.
Reply 6 months ago
Chetna (talkcontribs)
I think it implies that unlike the usual method in which we index arrays from 0, this program requires us to index from 1

dont understand test case week6 Assignment1: Computing Paradox
4 comments • 6 months ago
CKaur (talkcontribs)
For the program Computing Paradox How come for the test case 1: N=5 A equals to {1 2 3 9 4} K= 5 So after sorting list is {1 2 3 4 9} how come expected output is 4? after sorting list will be{1 2 3 4 9} so we need to look for index 4 which is 9. Isn't?
Reply Edited 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
in general indexing in array starts at 0. In the problem statement it is stated "1 indexing is used". it means indexing is starting from one instead of zero. Public testing case 1: k means index or position. before sorting when k=5, in position 5 in the given unsorted list, we have value 4. after sorting value 4 is at position 4. and hence 4 is the answer. Public test case 3: k=3. So in the unsorted list with index starting from one, the value at position 3 is 5. after sorting with index starting from one, value 5 will be at 5. find the value at the given position in the unsorted list find the location of the value in the sorted list. that will be the answer.
Reply Edited 6 months ago
CKaur (talkcontribs)
Oh we have to find position in unsorted list? Then what is the purpose of sorting the list?
Reply 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
making using of the position "k", you need to get the value in that position in the unsorted list. let it be "value" and then from the sorted list and print the position of the "value"

Kindly include Variations in test cases in public cases
3 comments • 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
Dear Descentis, Kindly introduce more public cases and introduce what ever variations you would like to introduce in the public cases. With variation in public cases, would bring more discussion on this forum as expected. Let the private cases be only jumbled versions of the public cases. So that students can think as they know their scope.and come up with their questions. Why dont we try this,

@Descentis Sir and @Simran Maam, <br> I have contributed so much to SUPER NOTES WEEK 5, yet I am not the STAR PERFORMER for this week, WHY? <br> I Have uploaded explanations as well as images and also multiple variations for a single problem with output screenshots, yet I receive no appreciation, WHY? <br> Statistically speaking I have uploaded 33,885 bytes of data and multiple images and no else is even close to this number. <br> Even after putting in so much of effort, if you dont receive a little appreciation, then how can you expect me to keep going.<br> @Arunkumar Friend I would like your views regarding the same.<br> Sudarshan Sir, Please let me know where did I go wrong ?<br> Also @Descentis and @Simran, what is the selection criteria I would love to know.<br>

A selfless contributor continues to contribute for not one hour,not one day, not one week, not one month, not one year, but day after day, week after week, month after month, year after year even if no one recognizes. He contributes because it is his nature. Keep Contributing definitely at some point of time you will be rewarded. You are already rewarded.. You now know how to Edit notes in this platform.. We have learned Scratch Program, Speech Recognition Program etc. These are the contributions by the Professor and the team. I wish more such new leanings come to us through this program. An Elite Gold Certificate or Internship down the lane for you is awaiting....

Hi all, I want to program every week the programs we have done already as assignments so that if atleast couple of them come in end examination, i will not spend much time in writing those programs. I want some one on the list help me to write a python program that exactly does what our programming browser does. Inputs to my program are:- 1. Test cases given each week 2. output of the test cases Output for the Program are:- Passed or failed. Which test case passed or failed Remember No of output test cases vary from program to program. Structure of the program;- Part A. Part B Part C Part A is the program which will vary from program to program Part B and Part C of the Program will take test cases file names and print the output. I dont want to change part b and part c. In Part A I will modify the following 1. I will rewrite my code of each assignment there to practice 2. Name of the input files can some one help me in developing this.
