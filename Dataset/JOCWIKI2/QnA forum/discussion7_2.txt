What is the minimum number of dice throws required to reach 100 in Snakes and Ladders game?

1.100
2.less than 30
3.more than 30
4.can't say
The answer is can't say as per the solution given. But can some one explain how it is possible to have more than 30 moves to reach 100(minimum)?

They have not mentioned about the no of iterations to make a judgement on minimum number of dice throws. IF the minimum number of dice throws is less than 5, it could be any thing. if the minimum number of dice throws is 10, we can simulate and see the answer as less than 30. Since the number of dice throws is not given the question is not completely stated, i would give correct answer to both 2 and 4.

Hello. Was working on 3rd programming assignment of week 8 and my code is passing all the tests shown but when I submit the code it give me 0.00/100.00. Can anybody suggest what I might be doing wrong? Can't post my code as it is not allowed. I am declaring a list of vowels and checking via index if adjacent characters are in list of vowels. It is working for any example I take and also for the examples specified. Thank you.

if i execute my program in my spider software it execute correctly but when i compile it in submission page it gives wrong output. Can anyone help me? following is the code:

@Shitalp, Yes, your code is working fine. I believe your logic is correct. So, lets not touch bottom half (bottom 2 for loops, used to add zeros, and print) and do a changes to the above half of your program, where you are initializing your matrix and taking input.

This is just to see if there is any error in taking input. So, please replace the entire top part with this below code and then try to submit please.

n=int(input())
m=[[col for col in list(map(int,input().split()))] for r in range(n)]
Please let me know if it worked or not.

Another problem could be, there is a space at the end of every row in your output.

1 2 3 4 5 6 9 8 7 8 
0 2 3 4 5 6 9 8 7 8 
0 0 3 4 5 6 9 8 7 8 
0 0 0 4 5 6 9 8 7 8 
0 0 0 0 5 6 9 8 7 8 
0 0 0 0 0 6 9 8 7 8 
0 0 0 0 0 0 9 8 7 8 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 7 8 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 7 8 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 8 
Update: Yes this is the problem. You need to remove spaces at the end of all rows, and you will pass all hidden tests cases.

With little patience, if your start debugging the code by introducing print statements after every line and see the output, you will be able to correct the code with ease. if the output of print statements is correct till some lines, you can remove those print statements,

My sincere advice to all the people for whom the code fails is to play see the output of code after each and every line . especially in the loops print with the loop indexes also along with the calculated variable.

Just an input at the beginning and expecting the output at the end is no fun.

@ Jai Prince it is tough as long as you dont use print statements to see what is happening. if i is the index of the outer loop and j is the index of inner loop, a[i][j] is the value i want to see i will keep( print "i=",i,"j=",j,"a[i][j]=" a[i][j])) ane see how the values are changing.

Our public test cases are all passing because they have given n=m in all the public test cases. In the private cases they could have given n=2 and m=3 and in another one n=3 and m=2 So kindly check where the looping is going wrong by giving printing the matrix for the above n not equal to m cases..

Reply Edited 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
you have defined your function as isbinarymatrix(m,n,matrix) and you are calling it as isbinray(n,m,matrix). When n is not equal to m, it killed your program. you have interchanged n,m in function definition and while calling the function.

Reply 6 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
Yes, it is having some problem with one of the Hidden test cases.

Please change your Print statements to

if (isBinaryMatrix(n,m,mat)):
    print("YES",end="")
else:
    print("NO",end="")
Maybe try to change how you test the matrix. I used a small program to pass all these test. We don't need to check every element in the matrix. Let me give you my process...

Binary matrix has a strong feature on which we can build a test condition. That is 0's and 1's. One test condition you used is to see if every element in the Matrix is equal to either 1 or 0, or not.

What i used is, Lets say if there is a binary list, is there any other way to check if it is not having anything other than 0 or 1?

and in python, all rows are nothing but lists. So, I tried to see if min and max of a list is not bigger or smaller than these two numbers.

I hope you can build a code using this information.

Reply Edited 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
we may even merge all these elements into one list and find the min and max.

I replied above, you have defined the function as def isBinaryMatrix(m,n,mat): You are passing the parameters m,n and while calling you are calling it by f(isBinaryMatrix(n,m,mat)): you have swapped the positions of n,m. as long as n=m it does not make any difference.once n is not equal to m. you will see the difference. Kindly correct this first.

Friend @Kamalakar, Swapping of variable is fine in their program (in the function). Because..

In function def isBinaryMatrix(m,n,mat):, they treated m as row and n as column.
And function variables are treated separately. Because of which m, n in the function are totally different variables.
In the main program n is row and m is column, if(isBinaryMatrix(n,m,mat)):.

flag=1

gmplot is required when longitude and latitude co-ordinates are to be inputted in google maps. But the question is "matplotlib is used to plot latitude longitude position on maps". That means any general map, not just google map. Then why the statement is false? If Google maps would have been mentioned here then the answer would be False. The correct answer should be true.

I have simulated the game for 5 times,10 times etc. when it is for 5 times, the minimum number is variable but when we play it for 10 times, the minimum is definitely less than 10. Since the no of games is not mentioned, can i take it cant say.

Yes the less than 30 times seems to be a more suitable answer.

Yes, minimum number of throws required to reach 100 is definitely less-than 30. For the given board positions in the lecture if the sequence of throws are say, for example 6,2,6,6,5,6,3. Then we reach 100. So minimum number of throws are less-than 30. Given any board with snake and ladder position definitely there will be a sequence of dice throws to reach 100 in less 30 throws.

the minimum number of moves is less than 30 anyway. what ever the snake and ladder positions are. But the answer says can't say. How is this possible...?

I've spent too long trying to figure out the print statement. I get everything correct except a space between the last number of each row and \n and an extra \n at the end of the last row. Help??? n = int(input()) m = [[c for c in list(map(int,input().split()))] for r in range(n) for i in range(n): for j in range(n): if i > j: m[i][j] = 0 for row in m: for col in row: print(col,end=" ") print()

use if statements in the last for loops if zzzzz : print(m[i][j],end=" ") else: print(m[i][j,end="") Think,play and keep appropriate value at zzzz. it will give you the answer. This should come in the last for loop instead of your single print statement . if loops you keep a space and in some of them with out a space.

since you said i if a[i][j] !=0 or a[i][j] not equal to 1 , it is always going to NO only. even if it is binary with only 0 or 1's if it a[i][j]=0, it means a[i][j]!=1, will be true. Since in the or statement if any one of them is true, it will pass. and is always going to the No condition. <pre> Instead of if(a[i][j]!=0 or a[i][j]!=1): Simply use if a[i][j] > 1: f=1 <\pre>

Fun With Turtle. Turtle to Create Your Photograph
11 comments • 6 months ago
Kamalakar (talkcontribs)
Dear all, Using Turtle, I have developed the following code. When we run it in turtle,it draws our photograph. Since it goes pixel by pixel it takes good amount of time. But it is fun to watch your photograph getting created. If you want to see, create a photograph of size 50X50 pixels and name it as mypicture.jpg and run the following code in spyder. There are two while loops and at the end one try except. if the browser merges the code into single lines for you to separate it out from PIL import Image import turtle import time a=turtle.Turtle() turtle.bgcolor("pink") # Open our image im = Image.open("my2.jpg") rgb_im = im.convert('RGB') width = rgb_im.size[0] height = rgb_im.size[1] # set some counters for current row and column and total pixels row = 1 col = 1 pix = 0 # create an empty output row rowdata = "" while row < height + 1: print("") print("Row number: " + str(row)) while col < width + 1: a.pendown() r, g, b = rgb_im.getpixel((col - 1, row - 1)) a.screen.colormode(255) a.pencolor(r,g,b) print(col-1,row-1,r,g,b) a.goto(col-1,row-1) col = col + 1 # increment the pixel count pix = pix + 1 rowdata = "" # increment the row... row = row + 1 # reset the column count col = 1 a.penup() a.goto(0,row-1) #a.reset() turtle.done() try: turtle.bye() except turtle.Terminator: pass

in the above program if we introduce a variable inc=5 and change the following three rows col=col+inc,row=row+inc and pixel=pixel+inc and introduce extraline a.pensize(inc) after the first while loop, the picture creation is very fast.

Few hints for all Week 7 Assignments.
5 comments • 6 months ago
Arunkumar (talkcontribs)
'''If you can Solve Assignment 1, It is very easy to solve Assignment 2. Both use very similar logic ''"Diagonal"'''''. To solve 2nd assignment, your logic should check all diagonals.<br /> === '''Symmetric matrix logic is <code>m<sub>rc</sub> = m<sub>cr</sub></code>''' === '''Update:''' Few more hints... '''NOTE:''' Please read this post, only if you are not getting any idea to solve Week 7 Assignments. I dont want everyone of us to think in the same way. Please try your best to find new ways too. ; this might solve Assignment 3 : Why can't we treat every row as a list? Lets say if there is a binary list, is there any other way to check if it is not having anything other than 0 or 1? Possibly using min/max? ; Hint for Assignment 1 and 2 : Can you print me this if i give you a number <pre> if m=4, I want 1,0 2,0 2,1 3,0 3,1 3,2 if m=2, I want 1,0 if m=7, I want 1,0 2,0 2,1 3,0 3,1 3,2 4,0 4,1 4,2 4,3 5,0 5,1 5,2 5,3 5,4 6,0 6,1 6,2 6,3 6,4 6,5 </pre>

The output of the following program is 12. It took me good amount of time to understand why it is coming as 12 check1 = ['Learn', 'Quiz', 'Practice', 'Contribute'] check2 = check1 check3 = check1[:] check2[0] = 'Code' check3[1] = 'Mcq' count = 0 for c in (check1, check2, check3): if c[0] == 'Code': count += 1 if c[1] == 'Mcq': count += 10 print (count) see what is happening by using id(check1),id(check2) and id(check3) to understand what exactly is happening. Very interesting Example.

In all public cases they have given N=M Since two variables are defined, they might have given a case where n!=m so kindly check the looping by your self taking two private cases where in one case n>m and in another case m>n and see if your code works. as i said, i am just learning python now. it is difficult for me to make out what exactly is happening in your code. 2. While writing the code i would put the function definition at the beginning and then write what ever code i want below it. the browser is mixing the lines. i could not make out which code is in which line.
