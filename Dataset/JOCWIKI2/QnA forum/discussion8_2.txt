‪Hi,‬
‪I have a question about what is happening in this video at 00:12:51 -‬
‪http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n10aiP7WvOo#t=771s.‬
‪It is not working on my laptop. First of all, what is this 'Timeline' that you have written here and secondly there is no such thing like 'UTC +05:30'. I don't know where you get it all of a sudden. Also, you told in the video to copy and paste it in excel, I have done the same but still not working and you are using something else not the excel as I can figure out. Lastly, it is not showing the result as it is there in the video that is for each and every comment it is showing neg, neu and pos but in my case, there is only one neg, pos and neu. Kindly, help me with this.‬

‪Sorry friends, I was out of city for few days and I don't have any information about recent updates/questions here. Please update me if I missed any important updates.‬
‪Note: Hello friends please share your programs too, if you have a better code or different approach than these programs. Everyone, who struggled to finish assignments, please ask you questions here. So that we all can learn and help each-other.‬
‪A1-Duplicate Elements - code:‬
‪a=list(map(int,input().split()))‬
b=[]
for i in a:
    if i not in b:
        b.append(i)
print(*b, end="")

‪A2-Panagrams - code:‬
‪import string‬
S = input()
def panagram(a):
    b=string.ascii_lowercase
    a= "".join(sorted(set(a.replace(" ", "").lower())))
    if a == b:
        return True
    else:
        return False

if panagram(S):
    print("YES", end="")
else:
    print("NO", end="")

‪A3-Vowels - code:‬
‪S = input()‬
def v_logic(a):
    b = ''
    vcount = 0
    for l in range(len(a)):
        if a[l].lower() in ['a','e','i','o','u']:
            vcount += 1
            if vcount == 1:
                b = b+a[l]
        else:
            b = b+a[l]
            vcount = 0
    return b

print(v_logic(S), end="")

‪Funniest part of the panagarams problem is you just need to take the input string convert it into a set of lower cases letters and check the length of the string. if the length of the string is greater than 26 answer is yes otherwise no.‬

Hints for assignments
14 comments • ‪6 months ago‬




‪Arunkumar (talkcontribs)‬
‪This post is only for those, who are not getting ideas to finish Assignments. I request everyone to add your logic and processes too, below.‬
‪Assignment-1: Duplicate Elements‬
‪We have already dealt with these sort of questions, so we no need hints for this, I think. If someone needs, please ask.‬

‪Assignment-2: Panagrams‬
‪Panagrams is a sentence which uses all 26 letters in the English alphabet. This is a well known example of such... The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog‬
‪Way 1: We can take each and every letter from a to z, and then check if it is in the sentence provided. You need a loop for this.‬
‪To generate alphabets we can use string.ascii_lowercase or string.ascii_uppercase‬
‪Way 2: We no need to use loops to check if all alphabets are there or not. We can remove duplicates and then see if they are equal to string.ascii_lowercase or string.ascii_uppercase‬
‪For this, we can use set or dictionary to remove duplicates and then use some string operations to get it done.‬

‪Assignment-3: Vowels‬
‪Given a string S of lowercase letters, remove consecutive vowels from S. After removing, the order of the list should be maintained.‬
‪Input: your article is in queue‬
‪Output: yor article is in qu‬
‪Way 1: This is similar to the Assignment 1. But here... We should not delete the 1st occurrence of vowel. We need to construct our loop in such a way that 1st occurrence is left untouched when program finds continuous vowels like in you and queue. This is little tricky.‬
‪Reply‬
‪Edited 6 months ago‬



‪Kamalakar (talkcontribs)‬
‪for assignment -2, if we use set, if you can think, the program will be just less than 10 lines. Understand there are characters other than alphabets in the given string. For Assignment -3, Reverse the string and use loops to do the execution. after execution again reverse the string. and print it.‬

‪I did not reverse my string but the problem I am getting is if the vowels are at the end. Pop does not work then.‬
‪Reply‬
‪6 months ago‬



‪Kamalakar (talkcontribs)‬
‪you can do with out reversing also. What i felt is it would be easy to program if we reverse the string. When you pop some thing out of a list in such situations the length of the list will change. What i did is instead of popping i assigned a value 999999 in that position where there are two consecutive vowels. then while printing i checked if the value is 999999 dont do any thing else print the value at that location in the list.‬

‪Reply‬

‪Kamalakar (talkcontribs)‬
‪pop is for list not for a string.‬
‪if you use pop you will end with the index out of range problem if i am correct‬
‪study the following for loop‬
‪for i in range(10):‬

‪   print(i)‬

‪   i=i+1‬
  
though i changed the value of i inside the loop it is not getting reflected. it still prints 0 to 9/
‪so if you pop out things, it will still the for loop indexes will not change. i think you have to use while loop in such case.‬
‪I didnot popout any thing. if there are consecutive vowels. i just replaced the vowel which needs to be striked out with a 999999‬
‪while printing i asked to print the list character only when it is not equal to 999999‬

‪Reply‬

‪Kamalakar (talkcontribs)‬
‪For a matrix to be equal to its transpose, it has to be a square matrix. Zero matrix means all the elements are to be zeros. zero matrix can be a square matrix and also a matrix where no of rows is not equal to no of coloumns. Square matrix means no of rows is equal to no of coloumns Identity matrix is a square matrix.. Go to Google images and see the examples of zero matrix and identity matrix. with the above hints you make out the answer.‬

‪@Devil, This is GOD helping you out.‬

‪The private test cases can have capital letters. Did your code pass the following test cases‬

‪1) your article is in queue‬

‪2) your article is in que ue‬

‪3.AEIOU‬

‪dont use pop. it is killing your program. because it removes the letters. and reduces the length of the string.‬

‪you are comparing the character i and i+1 and while doing so you are moving from left to right in the for loop. you need to move from right to left in the for loop as per the program statement.‬
‪if you have tried the example case "your article is in queue" your program has not passed this example case.‬
‪instead of popping out use other strategies like‬

‪1. getting the index value of the character which you need to pop out and put it in another list. while printing compare this list entities and if not found in this list print the character‬

‪2. if you need to remove the character replace it with a high number and then while printing ignore this character. convert the string into a list and do the processing‬

‪'''@Naveena418''', I hope you tried and spent enough time on understanding the above program. Here is the single line answer. Python, by default, treats all inputs as strings. * '''Take input as list'''. You are taking input as '''string''' and feeding that string to for loop. That is the reason, all characters are taken individually. * Please check previous Assignment answers to understand, how we used to take input into a '''list variable''' (test_list). : <code>map(int,input().split())</code> * use <code>print(*test_list, end="")</code> to print list.‬

‪Only based on the sum of ascii values, it willnot be able find two words are anagrams or not. e.g 'gel' 312 'ear' 312 'act' 312 'leg' 312‬

‪a = [0, 1, 2, 3] for a[-1] in a: print(a[-1]) Output it is printing is 0 1 2 2 Can some one explain why is this so.‬

‪'''Interesting question''' :) when we use <code>for i in range(3)</code> entire thing converts to this <code>for i in [0, 1, 2]</code> : Then, till all items '''in''' the list are finished, this loop will keep assigning items to <code>'''i'''</code>. :: 1st '''0''' is assigned, then '''1''', and lastly '''2'''. ; Now in your example... : we are using, a specific position of a '''list'''. : Index <code> -1 </code> means last position of the list. : Because of which, when we use <code>for a'''[-1]''' in a</code> following things happen. <pre> for a[-1] in a: print(a[-1]) Will change to for a[-1] in [0, 1, 2 ,3]: print(a[-1]) then to (2nd time) for a[-1] in [0, 1, 2 ,0]: print(a[-1]) then to (3rd time) for a[-1] in [0, 1, 2 ,1]: print(a[-1]) then to (4th time) for a[-1] in [0, 1, 2 ,2]: print(a[-1]) </pre> ; ...and assigning part in the list looks like this... : 1st a[-1] will be assigned/overwritten with '''0'''. :: <code>[0, 1, 2, '''0''']</code> : 2nd time, a[-1] will be assigned/overwritten with '''1'''. :: <code>[0, 1, 2, '''1''']</code> : 3rd time, a[-1] will be assigned/overwritten with '''2'''. :: <code>[0, 1, 2, '''2''']</code> : 4th time, a[-1] will be assigned/overwritten with '''2'''. :: <code>[0, 1, 2, '''2''']</code> '''NOTE:''' '''''I believe, when we use <code>range()</code>, numbers are generated, once, in the beginning of for loop. But, i think, this behaviour changes, when we read a variable. As the content of variable might change while for loop is running. So, Variable should be read and re-read every-time.'''''‬

‪We can prove that it is reading Variable every-time. We can also prove that, in the middle of the for loop, if length of list increases, loop will keep continuing. <pre> a=[0,1,2,3] for a[-1] in a: print(a[-1], a) for i in range(len(a)): a[i]=a[i]+10 print(a) </pre> '''DONT RUN BELOW CODE:''' (infinite loop) Use <code>ctrl + c</code> to exit infinite loop. <pre> a=[0,1,2,3] for a[-1] in a: print(a[-1], a) for i in range(len(a)): a[i]=a[i]+10 a.append(i) print(a) </pre> Now the question is... What happens when we start deleting one or more items? <pre> a=[0,1,2,3] for a[-1] in a: print(a[-1], a) for i in range(len(a)): a[i]=a[i]+10 a.pop(2) print(a) </pre> Remove without error <pre> a=[0,1,2,3] for a[-1] in a: print(a[-1], a) if a[-1] == 1: a.remove(1) print(a) </pre>‬

‪very difficult for me to understand what is happening here. Looks like it is replacing the value of a[-1] in the range of values.‬

‪why after passing all test cases this program is awarded with 33.33 marks only i am not getting the reason import string n = input("") b = str() for i in range(len(n)): b = b.lower() if b.count(n[i])<1: b+=n[i] b = b.replace(" ","") b = ''.join(sorted(b)) d = string.ascii_lowercase if b == d: print ("YES",end="") else: print("NO",end="")‬

‪Arunkumar (talkcontribs)‬
‪The way you are using <code>b = b.lower()</code> inside the for loop is causing the problem. Till we get to see the Hidden cases, we cant say why. For now, try to remove that line from the for loop. And why don't you apply lower on '''n''' itself, before using it in the for loop? We no need to preserve '''n''' anyway. Then everything worked. You can use <code>set()</code> or '''dictionary''' to remove duplicates, and avoid using for loops.‬

‪We debug any code like this... by using print statements, and changing/moving/removing parts of code. <pre> import string n = input("") b = str() n = n.lower() for i in range(len(n)): # b = b.lower() print("for - ",b) if b.count(n[i])<1: b+=n[i] print("if - ", b) b = b.replace(" ","") print("after replace - ",b) b = "".join(sorted(b)) print("after Join, sorted - ",b) d = string.ascii_lowercase if b == d: print ("YES", end="") else: print("NO", end="") </pre>‬

Use of Dictionaries in Snakes and Ladders Game.

‪I am seeing an advanced version of Snakes and Ladders Game in which dictionary concept is used for snakes and ladders position. Can we further simplify it by using dictionaries for remaining variables like player_name,player_count,turn etc.‬

‪In Week 9, we will work on NLP (Natural Language Processing). for this we will use '''nltk''' library/module (which is a 3.5 GB download). Below steps will be used to download nltk through the python console. <pre> import nltk nltk.download() </pre> After Executing above commands, a window will pop up. There we need to press the download button. With in the same window, we will be able to see where it is saving nltk (nltk_data), possibly it will be '''C:''' drive. '''''We should make sure that we have enough free space in the''''' '''C: drive'''.‬
