Use of Pass keyword

Puneet Patel (talkcontribs)
Can any one tell me about use of 'pass' keyword in loops. I was trying the assignments of Panagram and Vowels using 'continue'. How pass and continue differ. Please clarify

pass is used to just pass. it is to skip a mandatory statement.

for example:

if True:
   print("You are correct!")
else:
   pass
in this example, one can argue why to use "else", when we can skip the else part itself. Yes, this is a bad example. But I hope you can understand that "pass" is just to pass (do nothing), like when we are playing a game.

One thing to understand and note is... Can we skip without giving anything in the else part as below...?

if True:
   print("You are correct!")
else:

It will definitely fail. Because it is mandatory to add something in else. In such cases you can use pass.

Best situation based on my experience is... When I start writing a program, I create code blocks first. then I write the logic as below...

S = 'your article is in queue'

def v_logic(a):
    
    for l in range(len(a)):
        if a[l].lower() in ['a','e','i','o','u']:
            pass
        else:
            pass
    return b

def logic2():
    pass

print(v_logic(S), end="")

Final code:

S = 'your article is in queue'
#S ='Great part of life'    #gret part of life
#S = 'eel is electricity'   #el is electricity
#S = 'love hate and war'    #love hate and war

def v_logic(a):
    b = ''
    vcount = 0
    for l in range(len(a)):
        if a[l].lower() in ['a','e','i','o','u']:
            vcount += 1
            if vcount == 1:
                b = b+a[l]
        else:
            b = b+a[l]
            vcount = 0
    return b

print(v_logic(S), end="")

In General code does not get developed in one day. it takes few months to get the complete code and details. So for the code developers will initally get all the conditions in place. ie all the if conditions and else conditions. so to get complete details in if and else statements may require some time. so in such cases to check the code they may take the advantage of pass statement so that if it is already present they could just replace the pass statement with the necessary code.

Q.3 What does the function G.nodes() in networkx return?

It returns the number of nodes present in the graph G.
It returns the list of nodes present in the graph G.
It returns the tuple of nodes present in the graph G.
It returns the number of edges present in the graph G.
Answer should be tuple of nodes because in console we can see after writing G.nodes() we get output Out[4]: NodeView((1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9)) which is a tuple. Documentation also says it returns tuple.

Sorry friends, I am still busy with personal issues. Because of which I am unable to be online or help. But I can see there are a lot of you helping each other. It is superb. Keep going.

Note: Hello friends please share your programs too, if you have a better code or different approach than these programs. Everyone, who struggled to finish assignments, please ask you questions here. So that we all can learn and help each-other.

A1-Counter Spiral - code:
I need to accept this ans sorry, I didn't had time to solve this assignment by myself. So I used the same code from the video, with few changes.

row=int(input())
SM=[[col for col in list(map(int,input().split()))] for r in range(row)]
col=row; r=0; c=0; ccs=[]
while(r<row and c<col):
    for i in range(r, row):
        ccs.append(SM[i][c])
    c+=1
    for i in range(c, col):
        ccs.append(SM[row-1][i])
    row-=1
    if c<=col:
        for i in range(row-1, r-1, -1):
            ccs.append(SM[i][col-1])
    col-=1
    if r<row:
        for i in range(col-1, c-1, -1):
            ccs.append(SM[r][i])
    r+=1
print(*ccs, sep=" ", end="")

A2-Maximum Numeric - code:
I used Vowel code from previous Assignment to solve this Assignment.

import string
S = input()
b=''
acount = 0
for a in range(len(S)):
    if S[a] in ' '+string.ascii_lowercase:
        acount += 1
        if acount == 1:
            b = b+' '
    else:
        b = b+S[a]
        acount = 0

print(max(list(map(int,b.strip().split()))), end="")

A3-Email ID - code:
email=input()
print(email[email.index('@')+1:email.index('.')], end="")

NOTE: Please also check Sample solutions, Provided by instructor they are interestingly different approach/methods.

When the output of a process is qualitative, the answers will be adjective like high low or medium. When it is quantitative the output will be in the form of numbers. Stylometry we are drawing graphs. it means it is quantitative only.

Hello all! Can anybody give a hint for assignment 2 in week 9. I have converted the string into numbers only, then used the reverse sort. But problem is how do I do for numbers with different widths. I am able to get the correct o/p for test case 1 & 2 but while submitting it is 0/100.

I did it in a non optimized way but it worked for me (100/100). Here, 1) I replaced all aplhabets with "*" 2) Split the string using "*" (which will give list with empty items) 3) created list and add the non empty items to new list 5) Print the max item from the list using max(list) method

check if the character is a number or alphabet. if number there will be two are three numbers start a loop. Before the start of the loop assign sum=0 in the loop write sum=sum*10+number at the end append the sum to the list.

C++veteran (talkcontribs)
i'v managed to do it in O(n) complexity. i just added space between every consecutive alpha and numbers (eg: 'rt43qw' becomes 'rt 43 qw') and extracted the numbers then stored it in stack and returned the max number.

a=re.findall('\d+',S)

""" 1) Function findall() finds *all* the matches and returns them as a list

   2) inside findall() '\d+' is regular expression which finds digit  where ,
       \d = matches only (0123456789) ie.[0-9]
        + = it matches One or more char in our case digits[0-9]
