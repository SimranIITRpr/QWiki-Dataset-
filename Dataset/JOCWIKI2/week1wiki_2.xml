Week 1 is about basics of programming where we have tried to answer the following questions :

=What is a computer program?=
A computer program is a set of instructions that performs a specific task. 

=Why do we need to program ?=

Today in the digital world, most of what you see on your cell phone, computers or be it on the internet, webpage, etc., all of these are some programs written by someone. Someone should have written a piece of code for all these things to work on our fingertips. It makes our life really simple. Programming is about getting things done really fast. So, in order to develop or understand the functioning of this digital world, and make our life little faster and easier, we must learn to program.


=Can anybody learn programming?=
[[#Top]]

Yes, Programming is actually quite commonsensical. But there is one problem that a student faces majorly- a whole lot of discouragement.  So, its like if you come and tell me you want to learn French and I start off giving you literature in French, then you will be obviously discouraged. The next discouraging factor for someone to learn programming is that they end up feeling extremely discouraged by looking at someone who does really well. First one is whole lot of details we start with some complicated stage of programming we don’t start from scratch, secondly, people around you sort of discourage you and put you off. 

A one-word answer to the question is YES, in fact, anyone can program and it's a fairly easy process.


=Are there any prerequisites for the course?=
[[#Top]]

There are no prerequisites required for the course. We only expect you to know a little bit of computer handling and interest in learning.


10th Standard/High school passed student can also do this course.

=Where to start?=
[[#Top]]

Today there are so many languages. People often get confused about where to start. The important part in programming is understanding the programming logic behind every problem, not the programming language. You should start giving instructions to the machine.


=What is programming? =

[[#Top]]

Programming is the process of writing computer program which is a sequence of instructions which when given to computing machine accomplishes the desired task in specific pattern as instructed.
{{#ev:youtube|https://youtu.be/DxRm8YWVHzE|250|right}}
To enable the computer to undertake any task, our instructions have to be converted (from English) into a language or code, such as C, C++, Java, Python, which can be understood by the computer.

=How to give instructions? =

Instructions are programming language statements written in a program to do a specific task.

Instructions should be crystal clear. They should be articulated in such a way such that they are understood by each and everyone who are being instructed.

Week 1 is about basics of programming where we have tried to answer the following questions :

=What is a computer program?=
A computer program is a solution to a problem implemented by giving set on instruction to the computer to solve that specific problem.

Week 1 is about basics of programming where we have tried to answer the following questions :

=What is a computer program?=
A computer program is a tool used to make computer to do an expected task and give desired output, using a defined set of instructions in any computer programming language like c,c++,java, python etc.

The next discouraging factor for someone to learn programming is that they end up feeling extremely discouraged by looking at someone who does really well. First one is whole lot of details we start with some complicated stage of programming we don’t start from scratch, secondly, people around you sort of discourage you and put you off. 

A one-word answer to the question is YES, in fact, anyone can program and it's a fairly easy process.


=Are there any prerequisites for the course?=

There are no prerequisites required for the course. We only expect you to know a little bit of computer handling and interest in learning.


10th Standard/High school passed student can also do this course.

=Where to start?=
[[#Top]]

Today there are so many languages. People often get confused about where to start. The important part in programming is understanding the programming logic behind every problem, not the programming language. You should start giving instructions to the machine.

=What is programming? =

[[#Top]]

Programming is the process of writing computer program which is a sequence of instructions which when given to computing machine accomplishes the desired task in specific pattern as instructed.
It is also the process of representing an item as a program and making suitable rules for its successful execution. 

To enable the computer to undertake any task, our instructions have to be converted (from English) into a language or code, such as C, C++, Java, Python, which can be understood by the computer.

=How to give instructions? =

Instructions are programming language statements written in a program to do a specific task.

Instructions should be crystal clear. They should be articulated in such a way such that they are understood by each and everyone who are being instructed.

Week 1 is about basics of programming where we have tried to answer the following questions :

=What is a computer program?=
A computer program is a tool used to make computer to do an expected task and give desired output, using a defined set of instructions in any computer programming language like c,c++,java, python etc.

=Why do we need to program ?=

Today in the digital world, most of what you see on your cell phone, computers or be it on the internet, webpage, etc., all of these are some programs written by someone. Someone should have written a piece of code for all these things to work on our fingertips. It makes our life really simple. Programming is about getting things done really fast. So, in order to develop or understand the functioning of this digital world, and make our life little faster and easier, we must learn to program.

Week 1 is about basics of programming where we have tried to answer the following questions :

=What is a computer program?=
A computer program is a well defined set of instructions used to make computer to do an expected task and give desired output,written in any computer programming language like c,c++,java, python etc.It act as an interface between the user's ideas and the system.

=Why do we need to program ?=

Today in the digital world, most of what you see on your cell phone, computers or be it on the internet, webpage, etc., all of these are some programs written by someone. Someone should have written a piece of code for all these things to work on our fingertips. It makes our life really simple. Programming is about getting things done really fast. So, in order to develop or understand the functioning of this digital world, and make our life little faster and easier, we must learn to program.


=Can anybody learn programming?=
[[#Top]]

Yes, Programming is actually quite commonsensical. But there is one problem that a student faces majorly- a whole lot of discouragement.  So, its like if you come and tell me you want to learn French and I start off giving you literature in French, then you will be obviously discouraged. The next discouraging factor for someone to learn programming is that they end up feeling extremely discouraged by looking at someone who does really well. First one is whole lot of details we start with some complicated stage of programming we don’t start from scratch, secondly, people around you sort of discourage you and put you off. 

A one-word answer to the question is YES, in fact, anyone can program and it's a fairly easy process.


=Are there any prerequisites for the course?=
[[#Top]]

There are no prerequisites required for the course. We only expect you to know a little bit of computer handling and interest in learning.


10th Standard/High school passed student can also do this course.
Also, one should have the basic knowledge of using computer and mouse.

=Where to start?=
[[#Top]]

Today there are so many languages. People often get confused about where to start. The important part in programming is understanding the programming logic behind every problem, not the programming language. You should start giving instructions to the machine.
Knowing and trying to implement the Art of Articulation.

=What is programming? =

[[#Top]]

Programming is the process of writing computer program which is a sequence of instructions which when given to computing machine accomplishes the desired task in specific pattern as instructed.
It is also the process of representing an item as a program and making suitable rules for its successful execution. 

To enable the computer to undertake any task, our instructions have to be converted (from English) into a language or code, such as C, C++, Java, Python, which can be understood by the computer.

=How to give instructions? =

Instructions are programming language statements written stepwise in a program to do a specific task.

Instructions should be crystal clear. They should be articulated in such a way such that they are understood by each and everyone who are being instructed.

Give instruction --&gt; Follow --&gt; Get the task done

Week 1 is about the basics of programming where we have tried to answer the following questions :

What is a computer program?

A computer program is a well-defined set of instructions that are used to make computer to do an expected task and give the desired output, written in any computer programming language like C, C++, Java, Python, etc. It acts as an interface between the user's ideas and the system.

Why do we need to program?
Today in the digital world, most of what you see on your cell phone, computers or be it on the internet, webpage, etc., all of these are some programs written by someone. Someone should have written a piece of code for all these things to work on our fingertips. It makes our life really simple. Programming is about getting things done really fast. So, in order to develop or understand the functioning of this digital world, and make our life little faster and easier, we must learn to program.


Can anybody learn to program?
#Top

Yes, Programming is actually quite commonsensical. But there is one problem that a student faces majorly- a whole lot of discouragement.  So, it's like if you come and tell me you want to learn French and I start off giving you literature in French, then you will be obviously discouraged. The next discouraging factor for someone to learn programming is that they end up feeling extremely discouraged by looking at someone who does really well. First one is a whole lot of details we start with some complicated stage of programming we don’t start from scratch, secondly, people around you sort of discourage you and put you off. 
A one-word answer to the question is YES, in fact, anyone can program and it's a fairly easy process.

Are there any prerequisites for the course?
#Top

There are no prerequisites required for the course. We only expect you to know a little bit of computer handling and interest in learning. Also, one should have the ability to think logically.

Even, a 10th Standard/High school passed student can also finish this course. 

But, one should have a basic knowledge of using a computer and mouse.

Where to start?
#Top

Today there are so many languages. People often get confused about where to start. The important part of programming is understanding the programming logic behind every problem, not the programming language. You should start giving instructions to the machine.
Knowing and trying to implement the Art of Articulation.

What is programming? 

#Top

Programming is the process of writing a computer program which is a sequence of instructions which when given to computing machine accomplishes the desired task in a specific pattern as instructed.
It is also the process of representing an item as a program and making suitable rules for its successful execution. 

To enable the computer to undertake any task, our instructions have to be converted (from English) into a language or code, such as C, C++, Java, Python, which can be understood by the computer.

How to give instructions? 
Instructions are programming language statements written stepwise in a program to do a specific task.

Instructions should be crystal clear. They should be articulated in such a way such that they are understood by each and everyone who is being instructed.

Give instruction --&gt; Follow --&gt; Get the task done
